Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase","numLines":100,"startLine":1,"totalLines":185}}}

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_011uRasKvYxvqka3m8wGHbDx","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a good picture of session 13. Here's what I observe:\n\n1. **14 text-only turns** (turns 1, 6, 9, 11, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 35, 43) - major Rule B violations\n2. **0 parallel turns** - Rule A completely violated\n3. The session was an analysis session (like me right now)\n4. The agent spent multiple turns reading the same session file (.blacksmith/sessions/11.jsonl) with slight variations - turns 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 all read session 11.jsonl\n\n\n5. The core issue is inefficiency: the agent read the same file six times with different Python one-liners instead of loading it once and performing all analysis in parallel, violated Rule A entirely, and started with a text-only turn despite Rule 18 requiring a tool call on turn 1.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the existing improvement backlog to see what's already been identified and avoid duplicating work—there are 14 tracked items ranging from pre-satisfied bead verification through batching implementation file reads in a single parallel turn.\n\nLooking at the next batch of improvements, I see several more refinements needed: merging claim and understand steps, adding Rule B reminders at key checkpoints, removing redundant verification sections, and fixing stale commands. I also notice that three of these improvements—enforcing Turn 1 as a tool call, clarifying failed-attempt exit behavior, and prohibiting cargo check and ls exploration as standalone turns—were already filed during session 13, so I can skip those.\n\nNow I'm checking whether these improvements actually made it into PROMPT.md. From what I can see in the file, there's already a rule about running two parallel tool calls in the same turn, but I don't see the explicit \"Turn 1 = tool call\" enforcement yet, so that one likely hasn't been implemented.\n\nLooking at the patterns from session 13, I'm noticing something interesting: the same session file got read six times across different turns with only minor script variations, which suggests there might be some inefficiency in how the session data is being accessed. This is a new pattern not covered by open improvements. The metrics clearly show 0 parallel turns and 14 text-only turns, so most of these improvements haven't been resolved—the session itself violated the core efficiency rules we're trying to enforce. Looking at what could potentially be closed, none of the improvements seem definitively resolved. I'm noticing a couple of new patterns: the analysis agent read PROMPT.md via Bash cat multiple times across turns 3-5 when it should've used the Read tool once, and it repeatedly processed the same session file with iteratively refined scripts across turns 8, 10, 12-14, and 18 instead of getting it right the first time.\n\nScoring these patterns, the repeated PROMPT.md reads waste 2-3 turns per session and are easy to fix with an explicit instruction to use the Read tool—that's a score of 12. The iterative session parsing wastes 5-6 turns per session but requires more upfront planning to write a comprehensive script, also scoring 12. Though wait, both of these are issues with the analysis agent itself, not the main implementation agent. The PROMPT.md I'm reading is actually the main agent's prompt, so I need to think about whether these patterns are even relevant to what we're trying to improve.\n\nLooking back at the session data more carefully—session 13 included analysis commands like `blacksmith improve list`, then implementation commands like `bd create` and git operations. So session 13 was itself an analysis session, the same type of work I'm doing right now. That means improvements to PROMPT.md would actually affect future analysis sessions like this one.\n\nI'm realizing PROMPT.md governs all sessions—both implementation and analysis—so filing improvements there would benefit both types. Let me identify the key patterns worth capturing: the agent read the same session file six times with incrementally refined scripts instead of doing a comprehensive analysis upfront, which is inefficient. This pattern is specific to analysis work and should be addressed in the analysis guidance within PROMPT.md.\n\nI'm also noticing the agent used bash cat to read PROMPT.md three times instead of using the proper Read tool, which is a clear inefficiency worth documenting.\n\nLooking at the existing improvements, some appear to already be addressed in the current PROMPT.md version, so I should verify which ones are actually still open before filing new ones.\n\nBut there's a critical issue I'm catching: the session-end example still shows clippy and test running in parallel, which doesn't work since clippy --fix modifies source files that test needs to compile. That's a real problem that needs fixing.\n\nLooking at the actual steps in lines 88-92, they do show test running first sequentially, then clippy and fmt in parallel afterward, which is correct. So R11 appears resolved there, but R10 isn't—that parallel example at line 14 is still wrong and needs to be removed or corrected. R10 is still problematic—the Rule A example on line 14 incorrectly shows clippy and test as parallel when they shouldn't be, so I need to fix that specific line in the prompt.\n\nLooking at what I can actually close out, none of the improvements from this session are definitively resolved. But I'm identifying three new improvements to prioritize: first, consolidating analysis sessions to read the same JSONL file once instead of six times with iterative scripts; second, using the Read tool instead of Bash for file access, since I called Bash three times to read PROMPT.md when I should have used Read; and third, addressing the zero parallel turns issue, though I'm still weighing the impact of that one.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the parallel turns issue is already covered by other rules. What's more important is that for analysis sessions specifically, the first turn should include parallel tool calls—reading MEMORY.md and running the improve list command together rather than sequentially.\n\nNow I'm questioning whether PROMPT.md even applies to analysis sessions, since the analysis agent seems to use its own separate system prompt. If that's the case, then my improvements should target the analysis agent's prompt itself, not PROMPT.md.\n\nBut the task explicitly asks for PROMPT.md edits, so I need to focus on what would help implementation sessions. The problem is I only have data from session 13, which was an analysis session, not an implementation one. So I'm working with limited information about actual implementation performance. I'm realizing the distinction here - PROMPT.md is the implementation agent's instructions, not the analysis agent's. The analysis agent has its own system prompt, so changes to PROMPT.md would only affect implementation sessions, not the analysis sessions I've been observing. Even though the analysis agent read PROMPT.md in session 13, it was doing so to understand what to improve, not as its operating instructions. So I need to focus on what PROMPT.md edits would actually help implementation sessions, while recognizing that the analysis session's inefficiencies stem from the analysis agent not following rules that would apply if it were run with PROMPT.md as part of its own instructions. Looking at session 13, I notice the agent repeatedly read the same JSONL file with slightly different Python scripts instead of refining the approach iteratively—this inefficiency isn't covered by the existing open improvements, so it's worth filing as a new issue. The analysis agent's efficiency issues point to something bigger—I should focus on improvements that would actually help implementation sessions, not just this analysis run. Let me check what's already in PROMPT.md's code quality section and see which open improvements I can close or refine. I need to focus on what I can actually observe from this session. Since it was purely analysis work, I can't confirm whether any existing improvements were fixed, so I'll leave those open. Based on the data I'm seeing—14 text-only turns, zero parallel turns, and six reads of the same file—I'll file a few new improvements and then run through the standard blacksmith workflow: check PROMPT.md, review open improvements, close what's resolved, file new ones, create beads, and commit. I'm noticing the batch file analysis read the same session data six times across different turns—that's a significant waste of processing. While this might be specific to how the analysis unfolded, it points to a bigger issue: I'm iteratively refining analysis scripts across multiple turns instead of writing comprehensive ones upfront. R13 covers batching different implementation files in parallel, but this is about avoiding redundant re-reads of the same file. This feels like a solid improvement worth tracking—value of 4 for wasting five-plus turns, tractability of 3 since it needs explicit instruction, totaling 12.\n\nNow looking at the next pattern from turns 3-5 in session 13... the agent ran `cat PROMPT.md` via Bash 3 times. This wastes turns when a single Read call would suffice. But more importantly, the PROMPT.md read itself suggests the analysis agent was trying to understand what to improve rather than trusting the task description. This could be addressed by making the analysis task description more self-contained.\n\nHowever, this is about the analysis system prompt, not PROMPT.md. Not a good fit.\n\n**New improvement 2 alternative**: The session shows 32% text-only turns (14/43). R15 says \"Add Rule B inline reminders at Steps 3, 4, 5 to prevent narration-only turns.\" That's already open. So this is covered.\n\nLet me think of what else is new:\n\n**New improvement 2**: Looking at turns 30, 31, 35, and 43, the agent used text-only messages to synthesize information before taking action. Turn 31 is particularly telling—\"Now I have enough data to analyze. Let me synthesize my findings...\"—which shows the agent treating thinking as a separate turn. The fix is straightforward: PROMPT.md should explicitly say to combine thinking and actions in the same message rather than splitting them across turns.\n\nScore: value=3, tractability=4, total=12 ✓\n\nThis isn't covered by R15 (which targets Steps 3, 4, 5 of implementation, not analysis patterns).\n\n**New improvement 3**: Looking at the cost side—session 13 ran $1.46 just for analysis work across 74 total turns with 43 assistant turns, which is expensive for what should be straightforward improvement identification. The inefficiency is evident. Looking at the cost metrics, the cache read tokens are quite high at over 1.1 million, which suggests the context window is substantial, though the creation tokens are relatively modest. The total estimated cost of $1.46 seems reasonable given the analysis scope. I don't see clear evidence that any existing improvements have been resolved from this single session, so I'll hold off on closing those. I'll move forward with documenting the two new improvements about avoiding iterative file re-reads and eliminating standalone synthesis turns.\n\nBefore finalizing, I should check the current state of

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01YMpPDcbLyc5Dc7heof8tA5","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see all open improvements. Based on my PROMPT.md review, let me check which are resolved:\n\n1. R11 (Fix step 4b: cargo clippy --fix and fmt --check are sequential, not parallel): Looking at PROMPT.md lines 84-92:\n```\n**4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n```\nThe comment says \"Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls\" for clippy and fmt. \n\nBut R11 says they should be sequential. The issue is that if clippy --fix modifies the code, then fmt --check needs to run after to verify the fixed code is properly formatted. Running them in parallel means fmt --check might validate code before clippy has finished its modifications, which defeats the purpose of the quality gate.\n\nLooking at the remaining requirements, R16 still has the redundant Verification section in PROMPT.md that should be removed. R18 lacks an explicit rule enforcing that Turn 1 must include a tool call beyond the general guidelines. And R19 doesn't clearly state that blacksmith finish must always run after marking a failed attempt, even though the sequence is mentioned elsewhere in the documentation.\n\nNow I'm analyzing the session 13 data and seeing some critical patterns: 32% of turns were text-only responses, which violates Rule B significantly, and there were zero parallel turns despite Rule A requiring them. The agent also read the same session file six times with incrementally modified scripts instead of extracting all needed metrics in one comprehensive pass. I should file a new improvement that prohibits this iterative re-reading pattern—agents should write a single script that captures all necessary data rather than refining it across multiple turns.\n\nThe second improvement I'm filing addresses standalone synthesis turns, where the agent would write analysis conclusions without any tool calls, then file improvements in the next turn. This violates Rule B, so I need to add a specific example showing that synthesis and filing should happen together in one message.\n\nLooking at turns 3, 4, and 5, I notice the agent read PROMPT.md three separate times using bash commands when a single Read tool call would have sufficed—another instance of inefficient file access patterns that wastes turns and tokens.\n\nBut reconsidering the first improvement more carefully: those six file reads were part of an analysis session working with session data. The real issue is that analysis sessions should read MEMORY.md and run the improvement list command in parallel on the first turn, then write a single comprehensive Python script to extract all metrics from the session file in one bash call. This is more specific and actionable than just flagging repeated reads.\n\nNow I'm weighing whether PROMPT.md is even the right place for analysis-session-specific rules, since the analysis agent has its own separate system prompt. Looking back at session 13, the agent did read PROMPT.md but that was to understand what rules needed improving, not as operating instructions. Still, since the task requires filing improvements to PROMPT.md, I should proceed with that approach.\n\nLet me lock in my three improvements: first, I'll add a rule prohibiting iterative re-reads of the same file and requiring comprehensive analysis scripts written upfront in a single pass. Second, I'll expand Rule B with examples of synthesis anti-patterns to avoid. Third, I need to finalize what the third improvement should be. I notice that Turn 1 was text-only with no tool calls, which R18 is meant to address by requiring the first message to include a tool call. Since R18 is already open and not yet implemented, I shouldn't file a duplicate issue.
