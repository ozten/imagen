If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n   118→- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately.

Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n   132→- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n   133→- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n   134→\n   135→## Improvement Recording\n   136→\n   137→Record institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session.

Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\n   - **Run the finish command**:\n     ```bash\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \"<brief description>\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\n     ```\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\n\n## Turn Budget (R1)\n\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\n\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n\n## Improvement Recording\n\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\n\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\n\n**When NOT to record:**\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\n\n**How to record:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Short descriptive title\" \\\n  --category <workflow|cost|reliability|performance|code-quality> \\\n  --body \"What you learned and why it matters\" \\\n  --context \"Evidence: session number, file, or error message\"\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Always check Cargo.toml when adding new modules\" \\\n  --category reliability \\\n  --body \"New module files need their crate dependencies added to Cargo.toml. Cargo check catches this but only if run before bead closure.\" \\\n  --context \"Session 50 closed a bead with uncompilable code because Cargo.toml was missing the fs2 dependency\"\n```\n\nRecord improvements as you work — don't batch them to the end of the session.\n\n## Verification\n\nBefore closing a task, run these commands and ensure they pass:\n\n- test: `cargo test --release`\n- lint: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`\n- format: `cargo fmt --check`\n\n## Important\n- Do not ask for clarification — make reasonable decisions\n- Do NOT launch explore/research subagents (NO `Task` with `subagent_type: Explore`) — the architecture is in MEMORY.md\n- Do NOT re-read files you already know from MEMORY.md\n- Prefer small, atomic changes over large refactors\n- Always run `cargo test --release` before committing\n- Always run `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` then `cargo fmt --check` before committing — exactly ONCE each\n- Always use `blacksmith finish` to close out — do NOT manually run git add/commit/push/bd close/bd sync\n- **NEVER call `bd close` directly** — always go through `blacksmith finish` which enforces quality gates\n- **EFFICIENCY**: Re-read Rules A, B, C above. Every text-only turn and every sequential-when-parallel tool call wastes your limited turn budget. Aim for 5+ parallel turns per session and 0 narration-only turns.","numLines":185,"startLine":1,"totalLines":185}}}

Let me now analyze session 15 (the current session being analyzed). Session 15 is actually this current analysis session itself (the agent I'm running in). \n\nWait, actually I'm looking at session 15 data. The session being analyzed was session 15 but the data I'm reading from `/home/admin/imagen/.blacksmith/sessions/15.jsonl` is... wait, actually looking at the data more carefully, the session data I'm reading IS from session 15 and it shows the same kind of analysis patterns.\n\nWait, actually I need to re-read the situation. \n\nLooking at the metrics from session 15 - it ran for 398 seconds on 2026-02-24 and cost $1.17. The session file contains a recursive self-improvement analysis where the agent attempted to read a MEMORY.md file that doesn't exist, then tried to access other resources.\n\nSession 15 filed three improvements (R23, R24, R25) and created some image variants. I'm now analyzing that same session, and I notice the agent tried to parallelize reads of MEMORY.md and session 14.jsonl in the same turn, though the larger file was too big to load.\n\nLooking at the session metrics and data, the main issue that stands out is that MEMORY.md didn't exist, triggering a file-not-found error—which is exactly what R4 is supposed to address. The agent also made sequential reads when those could've been parallelized, suggesting there's still room for optimization in how context gets loaded. the agent got an error when trying to read MEMORY.md)\n- R23: \"Parallelize multiple blacksmith improve add calls in Improvement Recording section\" - Filed in session 15, no evidence it's been fixed\n- R24: \"Add Rule A look-ahead scan: batch next 2 turns' calls now\" - Filed in session 15\n- R25: \"Add parallel test-filter pattern to Rule A mandatory list\" - Filed in session 15\n\nShould I promote any improvements? R4 is still clearly an issue based on session 15 - the MEMORY.md file doesn't exist and the agent errored on it. So I should NOT promote R4.\n\nLooking at the data from sessions 14 and 15 for resolution of other improvements:\n- R1-R3: Can't tell from just these analysis sessions\n- R5-R25: Most appear to be about implementation sessions, not analysis sessions\n\nSince I only have session 15 to work with and it was also an analysis session, it's hard to know if implementation-related improvements have actually been addressed. For new improvements to file, I should focus on what I can directly observe from session 15's data: the agent produced narration-only turns with no tool calls, which violates R22/Rule B, and it reads PROMPT.md separately from other files rather than batching them together, which R13 already covers.\n\nThe most actionable new improvement I can identify is that the analysis agent wasted multiple turns trying to read large session files with the Read tool before switching to Bash. The PROMPT.md could guide the analysis agent on how to handle large files more efficiently from the start.\n\nFor the second candidate about parallelizing reads, it looks like existing rules already cover batching multiple operations together, so that's less of a novel improvement.\n\nThe third candidate about checking the blacksmith improvement list first would prevent duplicate analysis work, though it scores lower at 9. Let me scan through the existing improvements to make sure I'm not suggesting something that's already been addressed.\n\nLooking at the list, I see improvements for context loading, fixing the session-start example, and batching file reads, but nothing specifically about using Bash for large session files in analysis mode. Though actually, I'm realizing the PROMPT.md only governs implementation sessions, not analysis sessions like this one—those run on different instructions embedded in the system message. So filing improvements to PROMPT.md wouldn't directly help analysis sessions at all.\n\nBut I'm constrained to only filing PROMPT.md edits, so I should focus on what would actually improve the coding implementation sessions. Looking at the data from session 14 and 15, I see zero parallelism and mostly narration-only turns, which suggests the coding agent could benefit from clearer guidance on parallel execution patterns. not edits to the analysis agent's system prompt. Unless PROMPT.md is loaded into both... let me check the session 15 data more carefully. The agent read PROMPT.md directly, which suggests it's not automatically loaded into the analysis session either.\n\nSo my approach is: don't promote any improvements since I can't verify resolution from just one analysis session, but I can file up to 3 new improvements for PROMPT.md based on patterns I'm seeing. Looking at session 15, I notice it had narration-only turns and sequential tool calls rather than parallel execution, which suggests some optimization opportunities.\n\nThe main issues in implementation sessions are Rule A violations (no parallelism) and Rule B violations (narration-only turns). Most existing improvements already address these patterns, so I'm looking for gaps. One option is adding guidance on reading the blacksmith improve list in parallel with PROMPT.md, but that's more relevant to analysis sessions. A better candidate would be adding an explicit Rule B reminder at the \"Understand\" step in coding sessions. I'm running out of genuinely novel ideas—most candidates are already covered by existing rules. Looking back at session 15, I notice the PROMPT.md file itself has an issue: it instructs coding agents to reference MEMORY.md for project architecture, but that file doesn't actually exist. This is distinct from R4, which handles the analysis agent gracefully—here the problem is that the prompt is giving agents an instruction they can't follow. I should consider whether to update PROMPT.md to remove that reference or clarify what agents should do instead.\n\nThough actually, MEMORY.md might be intended as a per-project file that gets created, so maybe the better fix is to add a note saying agents should skip that context loading step if the file isn't present. But that overlaps with R4 which is already open.\n\nLet me look at something completely different. The PROMPT.md has redundancy in its verification sections—there's detailed substeps under Step 4, but then another \"## Verification\" section at the bottom that duplicates this.\n\nI'm also noticing the Turn Budget section references commands like `lint:fix` and `analyze` that R17 already flagged as outdated.\n\nLooking at the session 15 metrics, the cost was $1.17 for 57 entries across 398 seconds, driven mostly by cache creation and reads. The 882k cache read tokens suggest the session was repeatedly loading the system prompt and conversation history. I'm seeing a pattern where the agent tried reading session 14 multiple times—failed attempts followed by switching to bash—which hints at inefficiency in how retries are handled.\n\nI could suggest adding a note that the Read tool struggles with large .jsonl files and bash with python3 is better, but that's really only useful for the self-improvement agent, not the main coding agent. And since session 15 was purely analysis work with no implementation, there's limited signal about actual coding patterns.\n\nGiven I can only file 3 improvements and need to avoid duplicating what's already covered, I should focus on patterns that aren't already addressed by existing improvements.\n\nLooking back at session 15's behavior, the analysis agent made multiple sequential improve calls, violated the narration-only rule before creating beads, and created beads sequentially when they could theoretically be batched. Though actually, the bead creation calls do depend on each other's output for the IDs, so they can't really be parallelized anyway.\n\nThe bigger pattern I'm noticing is that session 15 itself violated Rule A persistently—the analysis agent made all its tool calls sequentially, which mirrors what I saw in sessions 13 and 14 with zero parallelism. This suggests the Rule A reminders in PROMPT.md aren't actually helping the analysis sessions, especially since they use an inline system prompt rather than PROMPT.md itself.\n\nFor implementation sessions, I need to think about what changes would actually help, but I'm realizing the improvements I was considering don't apply to PROMPT.md edits. Let me reconsider the approach here.\n\nI only have one analysis session to work with, so the data is limited. The practical next steps are to check if any existing improvements can be closed out, then identify 1-3 new improvements based on what I'm seeing. Looking at what's already been addressed, most of the patterns I'm noticing seem to overlap with improvements that are already open—R14 covers the parallel Claim and Understand steps, and R17 handles the outdated lint and analyze references.\n\nThere's also the sequential ordering issue with cargo clippy and fmt that R11 already tracks. The \"No Work Available\" section's instruction not to create git commits seems intentional rather than a gap. And the Verification section at the end appears redundant with Step 4, which R16 is already documenting.\n\nLooking at the \"Important\" section though—it repeats rules already covered in the main instructions, which just adds unnecessary length to the prompt. I could propose removing those redundant bullet points to trim token usage. That would score around 12 on value and tractability.\n\nThere's also something about cargo test commands in the PROMPT.md that might be worth examining. I'm noticing some potential inconsistencies in the command syntax. The PROMPT.md shows `bd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"...\"` with equals signs, but I'm not entirely sure if that matches the actual bd update syntax—it might need spaces instead. I should verify this against the session 15 data to catch any lurking syntax errors. There's also a question about Rule A in PROMPT.md that seems to be cut off mid-sentence, so I need to see what it's actually specifying.\n\nLooking at the session 15 patterns, I'm seeing narration-only turns like \"Now creating beads to implement each improvement:\" which directly violates Rule B, even though the improvements R15 and R22 are supposed to address this anti-pattern. The synthesis step at the end of the analysis workflow might be where this keeps slipping through.\n\nI'm considering whether a Rule B reminder specifically at Step 5 (Finish) in PROMPT.md would help, but checking the current state—Step 5 at lines 97-109 doesn't have one yet, which means R15 is still incomplete. Rather than duplicate that work, I should focus on what would actually help implementation sessions when there's limited data to work with, which brings me back to examining what PROMPT.md edits are still needed.\n\nLooking through the open improvements against the current PROMPT.md, I'm seeing that R1 about pre-satisfied beads is only partially addressed—the text handles adding a Verify section during Step 4, but doesn't specifically account for the fast path when a bead was already done before the agent started. R2 about skipping implementation entirely for pre-satisfied beads isn't addressed at all in the current version.\n\nFor R5, Step 4a just says to execute the steps as written without mentioning any batching of verify commands in parallel. R7 flags the session-start example as broken because `bd ready` and `blacksmith progress show` are shown as parallel when they're actually sequential (progress show needs the bead ID). And R10 points out that the cargo clippy and cargo test example shouldn't be shown as parallel either since they can't run simultaneously on the same codebase.\n\nNone of these issues are fixed in the current PROMPT.md, so I won't promote any existing improvements. Instead, I'm identifying three new improvements to file: removing the redundant ## Important section that duplicates rules already covered in the main body, and two others from recent sessions that score 6 or higher. I'm seeing the issue now—the PROMPT.md example claims `bd ready` and `blacksmith progress show` can run in parallel, but that's impossible since the progress command needs the ID that `bd ready` returns. This is exactly what R7 is supposed to fix. The documentation at lines 37-38 contradicts the sequential dependency, and I need to clarify that these commands must run sequentially, not in parallel. I keep circling back to things R7 already covers. Let me step back and look at what the PROMPT.md actually misses.\n\nThere are a few gaps: handling tool failures isn't explicitly addressed, though that might be too broad. The Turn Budget mentions `lint:fix` and `analyze` commands that R17 flagged as stale—those should probably map to actual cargo commands like `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`. And the instruction to STOP after `blacksmith finish` is already stated clearly.\n\nGiven what I can actually observe from this analysis, I should focus on concrete, non-duplicate improvements. The stale commands in the Turn Budget seem like the most actionable issue to address. Looking at the actual PROMPT.md content, I see the \"No Work Available\" section already explicitly states not to write a progress entry, so that improvement wouldn't be new. Let me identify three genuinely novel improvements that would actually strengthen the prompt.\n\nExamining the session data from 13-15, the persistent 0% parallelism across all sessions stands out as the core bottleneck. I could propose adding a \"parallelism checkpoint\" at turn 5 that forces batching if no parallel calls have been made yet, which would directly address this systemic issue rather than just optimizing around the edges. The agent had a narration-only turn before creating beads, and created them sequentially afterward—neither of which are real issues. But looking at coding sessions specifically, I notice the `bd show` command output often references PRD sections, yet the current guidance doesn't clarify whether agents should read those PRD sections in parallel with the implementation files. This could be a Turn A violation in the Understand step, so I should add a concrete parallel pattern for Step 2 that explicitly covers reading PRD sections alongside implementation files.\n\nI'm also considering whether to flag the cargo clippy --fix skip condition as a separate improvement, though it might overlap with an existing rule. Looking further at the Turn Budget section around turns 56-65 for the wrap-up phase...\n\nActually, I'm noticing something important about the session end pattern in PROMPT.md: it shows cargo clippy --fix and cargo test running in parallel, but that's incorrect because clippy --fix modifies files first, so tests need to run after those changes are applied. R10 is already open to address this sequencing issue.\n\nThe real question is what can actually be parallelized at session end. For Rust, cargo fmt --check doesn't modify anything and doesn't depend on clippy's output, so theoretically it could run independently. But if clippy --fix changes files, then fmt --check should verify those modified files are still properly formatted, which means it should run after clippy completes.\n\nI'm going to focus on filing clear, non-duplicate improvements rather than getting stuck on this complexity.\n\nFor the first improvement, I'm proposing that PROMPT.md Step 2 should note that when both a PRD section and source files are known, the agent should batch read both in parallel rather than sequentially.\n\nThe second improvement targets an inefficiency where agents re-read PROMPT.md as a standalone turn, but I'm realizing that for coding sessions, PROMPT.md is already the system prompt—agents don't actually need to read it separately since they already have access to it.\n\nLooking at other potential improvements, I could suggest clarifying that blacksmith finish auto-stages files so agents don't manually git add beforehand, but that's already documented in the PROMPT.md. I'm also considering a pattern about batching source and test file reads together, though that overlaps with an existing open improvement.\n\nLet me step back and focus on the most impactful, non-redundant improvements rather than going in circles. most valuable improvements not already covered:\n\n**Improvement 1**: \"Add Rule A look-ahead: after bd show, immediately identify and batch all file reads needed for implementation\"\n- More specific than R13 (which just says \"batch in one parallel turn\")\n- Adds the \"look-ahead\" concept: before any implementation, decide ALL files you need and read them in one turn\n- This is similar to R24 but more specific to Step 3 implementation\n- Actually R24 says \"Add Rule A look-ahead scan: batch next 2 turns' calls now\" - this is similar\n- Don't duplicate R24\n\nOK let me try a completely different angle. What about cost-related improvements?\n\nLooking at session 15 cost: $1.17 for 398s. This is $10.55/hour. For an analysis session with 882641 cache read tokens and 34867 cache creation tokens, I'm breaking down where the expense comes from. Cache reads account for roughly $0.10, cache creation around $0.13, but I need the input token count to get the full picture. The session cost estimate shows $1.17 total, though this is actually analyzing other sessions rather than a direct implementation session.\n\nFor a truly cost-focused improvement, the high cache read tokens (882641) suggest many turns with large context windows, while the cache creation tokens indicate substantial initial context setup. A 398-second session likely spans around 30-40 turns, so I should examine what's driving the most expense across those interactions. I need to refocus on the actual PROMPT.md file for the coding agent rather than the analysis agent. Looking at the data I have from sessions 13 and 14, both were analysis sessions with high narration-only turns and no parallelism, so they don't tell me much about what the coding agent actually struggles with. I should concentrate on improvements that would directly address the coding agent's prompt.\n\nThe first improvement I'm considering is adding a \"batch next actions\" checklist at the start of major sections in PROMPT.md to reinforce looking ahead for independent calls. But I'm realizing this overlaps significantly with rules I've already proposed—R15 and R24 already cover this pattern of batching and look-ahead behavior.\n\nLet me step back and focus on improvements that feel genuinely distinct and valuable. I'm settling on a cleaner approach: add a dedicated section to PROMPT.md for analysis sessions that explicitly instructs batching the initial reads—session file, PROMPT.md itself, and the improvement list—all in one turn. I'll also note that for large session files over 25000 tokens, using Bash and Python parsing is necessary since the Read tool will fail. This saves multiple turns per analysis session and feels like a concrete, actionable addition.\n\nFor the second improvement, I'm addressing a specific failure mode I've seen: when creating sub-beads with bd create, using --type process causes an error. The fix is straightforward—use --type task instead. Adding this to the workflow section prevents that mistake.\n\nThe third improvement tackles a subtle but real inefficiency: removing unnecessary narration turns before bead creation, which just adds overhead without advancing the work.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering the first improvement because it might be overlapping with existing guidance, so I should double-check whether it's truly distinct from what's already covered. could work if the analysis agent reads it first thing. But looking at session 15, the agent made tool calls before reading PROMPT.md, so that guidance would come too late.\n\nLet me focus on improvements that clearly help coding sessions instead. For the improvement recording section, I could add a note about batching all `blacksmith improve add` calls in one turn, but that's essentially what R23 already says about parallelizing them—I'd just be duplicating it.\n\nAnother option is documenting the valid bd create types in PROMPT.md to prevent validation errors, which is concrete and useful. Or I could add guidance for analysis agents on parsing large session files with Bash, but that's off-target if coding agents are the main users.\n\nI need to stop second-guessing myself and commit to what's actually valuable here.\n\nLooking at what I'm about to file, I notice R26 and R7 are essentially duplicates—both flag the same sequential vs. parallel issue in the bd ready and progress show commands, just in different sections of the documentation. I should consolidate these rather than file them separately.\n\nAfter checking R9, I see it already proposes splitting Context Loading step 1 into two parts: first running bd ready alone to get the bead ID, then running bd show and progress show in parallel once you have that ID. So R26 would be redundant.\n\nMy final three improvements are ready to file, starting with adding a valid bd create type example. list to prevent type validation errors in analysis sessions\"\n- Context: Session 15 had `bd create --type process` fail with \"invalid issue type: process\"\n- Concrete PROMPT.md edit: Add note to Step 5 or the Improvement Recording section: \"When creating beads with bd create, use --type task (not --type process which is invalid and will fail). Valid --type values: task, bug, feature.\"\n- Score: Value 3, Tractability 5, Score 15 ✓\n\n**Improvement 2**: \"Add large-file parsing pattern for session analysis: use Bash+python3 not Read tool\"\n- Context: Session 15 wasted 3 turns trying to use Read tool on large session .jsonl files before switching to Bash\n- Concrete PROMPT.md edit: Add guidance to use Bash with python3 for parsing session .jsonl files in `.blacksmith/sessions/` since the Read tool fails on files exceeding 25000 tokens, with an example showing how to pipe the file through a Python script\n- Score: Value 4, Tractability 4, Score 16 ✓\n\n**Improvement 3**: \"Add Rule B reminder to pre-bead-creation narration: merge narration with first bd create call\"\n- Context: Session 15 had a standalone text-only turn announcing bead creation before actually creating them\n- This pattern isn't explicitly covered by existing improvements, though R22 addresses the broader standalone synthesis anti-pattern\n- Concrete PROMPT.md edit: Add to the Improvement Recording section that narration should be included in the same turn as the first bd create call, not as a separate turn beforehand\n- Score: Value 3, Tractability 4, Score 12 ✓\n\nNow I'm checking whether any open improvements have already been applied to PROMPT.md to determine if any should be promoted or dismissed, but Session 15 was an analysis session so I can't definitively tell if implementation improvements have been addressed yet.\n\nLooking at the current PROMPT.md, I can see several improvements haven't been resolved: the broken example at lines 37-38 that R7 targets is still there, the Verification section R16 flagged remains unchanged, the lint:fix and analyze commands R17 identified are still present, and there are no inline Rule B reminders or turn-10 checkpoint that R15 and R12 called for. Since none of the open improvements appear to have been implemented, I won't promote any of them.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering Improvement 2 about large-file parsing patterns—while it's more relevant to my analysis work than to the coding agent, it actually makes sense to add it to PROMPT.md since I explicitly reference that file when analyzing sessions. So I'll move forward with filing all three improvements and then executing the commands to create beads and

Despite all the rules about batching, session 15 had zero parallel tool calls.\n \nLooking at the 25 open improvements, none appear to have been implemented yet based on PROMPT.md, so I won't promote any. For new improvements, I'm identifying the most impactful ones from the session 15 analysis: a workaround for large-file handling that wasted turns trying to read session .jsonl files, and a fix for the narration violation in Turn 40 by adding a Rule B example. place to add this would be in the \"Analysis Sessions\" section or somewhere prominent in PROMPT.md. Since the analysis agent actually reads PROMPT.md, I can add a note there about using Bash+python3 when processing large session .jsonl files instead of the Read tool.\n\nLet me go ahead and file these three improvements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13952,"cache_read_input_tokens":39969,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":13952,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0c8560e5-f97a-453d-9873-c9ba807cd22e","uuid":"1295a5ad-c232-4204-9e31-6de2235fa4f6"}
