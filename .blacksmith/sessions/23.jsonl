{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01GDWEr9jicmKFbK8ycvSQYk","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a very clear picture of session 22's problems:\n\n1. **Turn 1 is NARRATION** - Violates R18 (first turn must include bd ready) and R43 (all tool calls must be parallel)\n2. **Zero parallel turns** - All tool calls were single. Despite R43 saying all tool calls must be parallel, this session had 0 parallel turns out of 20 tool-call turns\n3. **12 narration-only turns (37.5%)** - Very high, including turns 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, 26, 30, 32\n\n\n4. **Multiple R27 and R28 violations** - Agent checked bd help mid-session instead of upfront, and added unnecessary narration before tool calls like \"Now create beads for all 3 improvements in ONE parallel turn\" and \"All 3 beads created. Now commit\"\n5. **Turns 2-7 were independent single Bash calls** - These should have been parallelized but weren't\n\nThe core issue is that Turn 1's narration-only violation cascaded through the entire session, preventing the agent from establishing the parallel execution pattern that should have governed all subsequent tool calls.\n\nNow I'm checking which improvements have actually been resolved versus which still need work. R26 about the Bash+python3 pattern seems to already be in use during the session, but I need to verify if it's actually documented in the prompt or if it's just happening organically. Let me review what's still open and what can be promoted or dismissed based on the session 22 behavior.\n\nLooking at the data, most of these improvements aren't clearly resolved yet. R29 about batching promote/dismiss calls can't be evaluated since no improvements were closed. R33 about consolidating metrics still shows separate commands being run rather than one comprehensive call. R36 appears resolved since the full list of 43 improvements came through without truncation. But R43 about parallel tool calls definitely isn't resolved—the entire session had zero parallel turns.\n\nSo the real question is what new improvements should I file based on what I'm seeing.\n\nThere's a recurring pattern where Turn 1 is just narration instead of a tool call. R18 already says the first message should include a tool call, but the analysis session violates this. For analysis sessions specifically, Turn 1 should be running python3 on the session file and blacksmith improve list in parallel, not explaining what I'm about to do.\n\nThere's also a pattern of narration happening right before bd create commands—like in Turn 19 where I'm describing what I'm about to do instead of just doing it. The agent is still encountering invalid issue type errors mid-session despite previous improvements, which suggests R27 hasn't fully resolved the problem. Looking at the data gathering phase, turns 2-13 show sequential bash calls that could have been parallelized, indicating R33 and R43 remain unresolved. I'm evaluating which improvements would have the highest impact — making the initial analysis turn use parallel tool calls would save multiple turns per session, but that's already covered by existing rules. The more pressing gap seems to be adding an explicit rule against pre-action narration turns with concrete examples from this session. Looking at the patterns I'm finding, R43 about parallel tool calls is already flagged as open, so I shouldn't duplicate it. But I'm noticing the synthesis turns where the agent narrates conclusions mid-session—like turn 15 where it writes out findings before acting—are both narration-only violations and wasteful on tokens, which R22 is supposed to address but hasn't been implemented yet. There's also the repeated Bash calls to validate types, though that ties back to R27 which is already open.\n\nI could propose combining the analysis conclusion with the first tool call of the next phase instead of splitting them into separate turns, but that's really just Rule B compliance. Looking deeper at the 12 narration turns across the session, most are either empty or contain synthesis statements like \"Now I have a complete picture\" or \"Let me run a comprehensive analysis\"—these feel like the core inefficiency to address.\n\nThe real pattern I'm noticing is Turn 26, where the agent echoes back the valid types as narration before actually using them. That's a wasted turn—the information should flow directly into action without the intermediate echo step.\n\nLooking at the empty narration turns scattered throughout, those seem like they might be thinking artifacts rather than actual problems to solve with rules.\n\nThe key insight is that R39 would actually catch the Turn 26 pattern—requiring a tool call immediately after receiving a result, which would eliminate the unnecessary narration turn. So that's already covered.\n\nFor genuinely new improvements, I should focus on patterns that aren't addressed by existing rules. The announce-then-act anti-pattern where the agent narrates what it's about to do before doing it is one worth capturing. → X. The announcement turn is wasted. Need a specific rule: \"Never emit a turn that only announces what you will do next.\" This is similar to R28 but broader. Maybe value=4, tractability=4 = score 16.\n\nBut wait - is this covered by existing improvements?\n- R28: \"Add Rule B anti-pattern example for pre-creation narration in Improvement Recording section\" - specific to Improvement Recording\n- R22: \"Add standalone synthesis anti-pattern example to Rule B\" - covers synthesis narration\n- R39: \"Add Rule C: after any tool result, next turn must include tool call or be final answer\"\n\nR39 would cover the \"announce then act\" pattern if \"announce\" comes after a tool result. Turn 19 comes after Turn 18 (a Bash call), so R39 would catch that. This is already covered.\n\nNow looking at the empty assistant turns - there are 5 turns with no content, which shouldn't happen. The agent shouldn't emit empty messages. Checking against existing improvements: R18 handles Turn 1 being a tool call, and R39 would prevent empty turns after tool results since it requires either a tool call or final answer. These are already tracked, so no new improvement needed here.\n\nFor the parallel tool calls issue - R27 is already open for adding valid types to PROMPT.md, and R43 is open for requiring all tool calls to be parallel. R32 covers adding an Analysis Session workflow section with parallel patterns. These together should address why the session had zero parallel calls across all 20 tool invocations.\n\nLooking at the actual sequence of turns, I'm seeing a clear pattern in the data gathering phase: turns 2-7 and 9-10 were all individual Bash calls executed sequentially - reading the session file, checking message types, counting turns, listing improvements, checking the counter, getting turn-by-turn breakdowns, and verifying the bd help output. None of these were batched together despite being independent operations that could've run in parallel.\n\nR33 addresses consolidating the Python scripts into one comprehensive script, which would handle most of this, but it doesn't explicitly call out the parallelization opportunity. The improvement I'm considering is more specific: requiring that all data gathering happens in a single turn using one consolidated Python script plus one blacksmith improve list call, with both running in parallel. That's more actionable than just \"consolidate into one script\" because it also specifies the execution strategy.\n\nLet me step back and look for patterns that aren't already covered by the existing recommendations. I need to check whether the analysis agent is reading MEMORY.md—R42 prohibits it, but I should verify what Turn 2 actually read in the

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01K76MdHWASaESkxtUr2eVUR","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a full picture of session 22:\n\n**Key findings:**\n1. **Turn 2: Read MEMORY.md** - Despite R42 (prohibit reading MEMORY.md), the agent STILL read MEMORY.md. R42 is not resolved.2. **Turns 3-7, 10, 13: 7 sequential cat | python3 calls for session 21** - Multiple incremental analysis scripts. R33 not resolved.\n3. **0 parallel turns** - R43 not resolved.\n4. **12 narration turns (37.5%)** - High ratio. R39, R15 not resolved.\n\n\n5. **Turns 20-22, 25, 27-29: bd create command attempts** - First tried an invalid process type, checked help after failing, then switched to chore type. R27 remains unresolved.\n\nNone of the open improvements appear resolved. The session shows the same patterns continuing. Since nothing's been fixed, I won't promote or dismiss any of them—they're all still relevant.\n\nLooking at new improvements to add, I need patterns not already covered. The session file being analyzed through seven piped cat and python3 operations stands out as a potential area to address.\n\nI'm also noticing that MEMORY.md was accessed even though R42 should prevent it, though that rule hasn't been implemented in the prompt yet. More importantly, Turn 1 being pure narration suggests the agent is thinking before acting rather than immediately executing parallel tool calls. For analysis sessions specifically, the first turn should launch both a session read and blacksmith improve list simultaneously instead of starting with narration.\n\nThis is really a specialization of R43's parallel execution rule. While R43 requires all tool calls to be parallel, it doesn't explicitly mandate that Turn 1 itself must be a tool call. R18 enforces Turn 1 as a tool call for coding sessions (with bd ready), but that doesn't apply to analysis sessions. So there's a gap—I should add a specific rule that analysis sessions must start with parallel data gathering, no narration. That would save a turn and establish the right execution pattern from the start.\n\nFor the PROMPT.md edit, I'd add to the Analysis Session section that Turn 1 must emit tool calls in parallel—specifically a python3 session read and blacksmith improve list—and never begin with narration. This fills the gap that R43 leaves open.\n\nNow looking at the result echo anti-pattern from Turn 26, where the agent narrated \"Valid types: bug|feature|...\" after receiving the tool result. R39 should cover this since it requires the next turn after a tool result to include actual work, not just echoing back what was returned.\n\nFor the duplicate bd creates across turns 20-22 and 27-29, the agent retried with --type process which was invalid, so those attempts failed rather than creating duplicates. R27 already addresses this by adding valid types to the prompt.\n\nI'm now thinking through what genuinely new improvements I can file that aren't already covered by existing rules.\n\nThe first gap is that Turn 1 should combine data gathering in parallel—running the python3 session script and blacksmith improve list simultaneously rather than sequentially, which would save a turn. This needs a specific edit to PROMPT.md's Analysis Session Step 1.\n\nThe second potential improvement is about batching the improve add calls and bd creates more aggressively. Currently they're spread across multiple sequential turns, but R23 and R41 already address parallelizing improve adds and batching bd creates, so this might already be covered.\n\nLooking at the analysis session flow, those five sequential Bash calls in Turns 3-7 analyzing the session file could be consolidated into one script run, which R33 and R43 seem to handle.\n\nNow I'm noticing the synthesis turns—Turn 12 and Turn 15 where the agent narrates findings before acting. These feel wasteful since they're just writing out analysis that's already been computed. I need to check if R22 covers eliminating these synthesis narration turns or if this is genuinely a new optimization opportunity.\n\nThen there's Turn 30, the pre-commit narration where the agent says \"All 3 beads created. Now commit:\" before actually committing in Turn 31. That's a Rule C violation since narration shouldn't sit between a result and the action that follows it.\n\nLet me step back and check what the PROMPT.md Analysis Session section actually contains right now. R32 mentions adding this section, which suggests it doesn't exist yet. If it were implemented, it would need to specify parallel patterns for all analysis-agent calls and clarify the correct session file path.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something more fundamental: the agent analyzed session 21's file across multiple turns, but the task explicitly asks for session 22 metrics. That's a reasoning error—it should be reading the current session's data, not the previous one.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Session 22 is the analysis session itself, so it makes sense to analyze session 21 as the most recent completed coding work. The metrics shown in the task are from session 22's execution (the analysis run), but the patterns to extract come from session 21. That's actually correct.\n\nSo the agent's approach was sound. Now I need to identify what's genuinely novel beyond the patterns already documented—the sequential analysis scripts are just R33 again, so I'm looking for something else that distinguishes this session.\n\nThe announce-then-act pattern shows up repeatedly across multiple turns, which existing rules partially cover but maybe not comprehensively for analysis sessions. More importantly, Turn 1 starting with narration instead of immediate tool calls seems like a gap—the rules mandate parallel tool calls but don't explicitly require Turn 1 to be tool calls rather than thinking. I should add a specific rule that analysis sessions must emit the session analysis and improvement list as parallel tool calls right from Turn 1, eliminating the narration overhead.\n\nThe final summary turn is fine—that's an acceptable conclusion. But I'm noticing the session had a lot of sequential tool calls that could've been parallelized: three improve add calls, then three bd create calls, then three more bd create calls. That's inefficient, though existing rules already address batching and parallelization for these operations.\n\nI can identify one clear new improvement: Turn 1 should emit parallel tool calls instead of starting with narration—both the python3 session script and the blacksmith improve list in a single turn. That's worth filing since it's not covered yet.\n\nLooking at the cost side, this 32-turn analysis session ran $0.90 just to analyze one session, which feels expensive for what was accomplished.\n\nThe real issue I'm spotting is that the agent re-ran the session parser multiple times across turns 3-7, iteratively refining the same analysis instead of doing it comprehensively upfront. And then the improve list didn't get generated until turn 9, seven turns too late—it should have been part of that initial parallel execution in turn 1.\n\nI think the key new improvement is mandating that for analysis sessions, turn 1 must emit both the comprehensive session analysis script and the improve list in parallel, with no narration or thinking preamble. R43 covers parallel tool calls generally, and R18 addresses turn 1 for coding sessions, but there's no explicit rule for analysis sessions. This fills that gap.\n\nThe ordering matters too—running both in parallel from the start would have saved multiple turns compared to running the analysis first and the improve list later. And I'm noticing a pattern where turn 1 often contains just empty narration, which is wasteful but easy to miss. The parallel tool calls mandate addresses that directly.\n\nNow I'm looking at session 22 more carefully to find genuinely new patterns. The agent ran multiple separate scripts when it could've consolidated them, but that's already captured in existing improvements. There's also the `cat | python3` pattern versus opening files directly in the script, though that's more of a style preference than a meaningful inefficiency.\n\nI notice the agent echoed data before using it in turn 26, but that's already covered. The sequential improve add and bd create calls across turns 16-18 and 27-29 should've been parallelized, but those are already addressed by existing rules.\n\nSo I'm settling on three genuinely new improvements that aren't covered yet, starting with requiring parallel tool calls in the Analysis Session's first turn. I'm trying to pin down what's actually new here beyond R32. The vague framing of \"add Analysis Session workflow section\" makes it hard to know what specific improvements are missing. Let me look for other patterns instead — like whether the agent is reading PROMPT.md when it shouldn't be, or if there are other structural issues I'm overlooking.\n\nActually, checking the tool calls more carefully, I don't see any PROMPT.md reads in this session, so R38 wasn't violated. But I'm going in circles trying to extract every possible improvement. Let me focus on the clearest gaps I've found: the Analysis Session section needs an explicit mandate that Turn 1 must run parallel operations — the comprehensive session parse script and the blacksmith improve list simultaneously — with any narration counting as a violation. This isn't covered by existing improvements and would have real impact. I'm noticing a pattern where the agent produces completely empty narration turns—5 out of 12 had zero content. Looking at the existing rules, R18, R39, and R15 address related issues but none explicitly forbid empty responses. I should add a direct rule: never emit an empty message.\n\nNow examining the session costs, the cache read tokens are massive at 543K per turn, which is driving up expenses significantly. The cache creation tokens suggest the initial prompt and context are quite large, especially if MEMORY.md gets loaded early. Looking at the token costs, that pricing aligns with Sonnet's rates. I'm noticing a pattern in how these improvements are being framed—they're focused on concrete operational constraints rather than abstract principles. Session 22 captured three solid rules around parallelization and file access that directly address the cost and efficiency issues I'm seeing.\n\nNow I'm committing to three specific improvements. The first is mandating that Turn 1 of the analysis session must emit parallel tool calls—a Python script to parse the session and the blacksmith improve list command together, with any narration before that being a Rule A violation. That scores at 25 points.\n\nI'm also noticing something important: session 22 filed those improvements without reviewing what was already documented, which means there's a real risk of duplicating work across sessions. That's a pattern worth addressing directly.\n\nThe core issue is timing—the agent ran the improve list check in Turn 9, well after starting the analysis in Turns 3-7, so it couldn't catch duplicates while working. If both the session parse and the improve list ran together in Turn 1, the agent would have the full context from the start and could flag conflicts immediately. This circles back to the same Turn 1 parallel mandate.\n\nOn the promote/dismiss front, the session correctly identified that no improvements were resolved and skipped those calls—that's actually fine. But the bigger inefficiency is running seven separate Python scripts across Turns 3-7, 10, and 13 when a single comprehensive script analyzing session 21 would've accomplished the same thing in one turn.\n\nThe root cause is that the agent didn't know upfront what metrics to extract—it iteratively refined the parser each time (checking message types, counting turns, validating paths, analyzing turn-by-turn patterns). The fix would be providing a template script in the Analysis Session section that extracts all needed metrics at once: message type counts, turn counts, tool call names, parallel turn detection, and narration ratio. This directly addresses the R33 violation about consolidating sequential single-bash calls. 33 doesn't actually provide the template, so this is a concrete extension. I'm going to file these two improvements: the Turn 1 mandate for analysis sessions, and the specific python3 template script for PROMPT.md.\n\nLooking at the other patterns—the bd create retry issue is already tracked in R27, and the parallel blacksmith calls are covered by R23. Neither of those are new problems.\n\nBut this session reveals something else: between the improvements and the bd creates, there was a whole chain of narration, failed attempts with the wrong type, help checks, and more narration that stretched what should've been a single parallel operation into 10 turns. The agent kept narrating and checking instead of just executing the right command.\n\nSo here's a better approach: what if improve add and bd create for each improvement happened in the same turn? That would eliminate the narration gap entirely. The tricky part is that bd create needs to know the improvement references to set the design correctly, but actually, looking at it more carefully, bd create might not even need those references.\n\nLet me think about what's actually actionable here. I could file a new rule about the Analysis Session Turn 1 mandate, extend the python3 template script to handle one-pass session parsing more explicitly, and then identify one more pattern I'm missing. Actually, I'm noticing the agent consistently ignored the rule about batching promote and dismiss calls into a single parallel turn—that's another pattern worth documenting.\n\nLooking back at R43, it says all tool calls in an Analysis Session must be parallel, but it doesn't specifically mandate how Turn 1 should be structured. So maybe I'm overthinking this. Let me just commit to two concrete improvements: making sure Turn 1 of the Analysis Session uses parallel tool calls, and adding a concrete python3 template to the prompt that shows how to parse a session file in one pass.\n\nActually, wait—there's a third pattern I'm noticing. In Turns 12 and 15, the agent produced narration about the findings after extracting the session metrics, instead of jumping straight to filing improvements. That's a gap worth addressing.\n\nBut looking at the existing rules, R22 covers synthesis anti-patterns broadly, and R39 already mandates that after any tool result, the next turn must include a tool call or be final—so this is already captured.\n\nLet me step back and look at the cache costs instead. The cache_read_tokens hit 543,090, which is massive for a 32-turn session. That's averaging around 17K tokens per turn being re-read from cache, which suggests there's real inefficiency in how the context is being structured or reused.\n\nThe system prompt itself is large since this is Claude Code, but there's also the issue of reading MEMORY.md early in the session—if that file is around 2K tokens and gets read in Turn 2, it then gets re-read by every subsequent turn, adding roughly 60K in unnecessary cache reads. And the session 21 data file is being read repeatedly throughout the session, with each read result staying in the context and being re-read by all following turns. If that file is about 10K tokens and it's read 7 times, that's potentially 70K tokens of redundant session data accumulating in the context.\n\nWith 25 more turns after the initial reads, that compounds to around 1.75M extra token reads just from the session file repetition alone—which translates to meaningful cost savings if we can consolidate those reads into a single operation. This validates the importance of R33, though it's already being tracked.\n\nThe real opportunity here is being more intentional about what tool results actually end up in the context during analysis sessions. When running commands like `blacksmith improve list`, the output stays in context for all subsequent turns, so I should avoid re-running the same commands or echoing full results unnecessarily. The goal is to run each analysis command once, keep the output available, and then proceed directly to the next step without duplicating context.\n\nLooking at the actual session data, I'm seeing mostly Bash commands (19 total) and a single Read operation, with the Bash calls split between analysis scripts, blacksmith commands, and process creation. Given that I can only identify two genuinely new improvements from this analysis and the guidelines allow up to three, I'll move forward with filing those two.\n\nThe first improvement I'm documenting is about enforcing parallel tool execution in the initial turn of analysis sessions—specifically requiring that the comprehensive session analysis script and blacksmith improve list run together rather than sequentially, since any narration in Turn 1 violates the core rules.\n\nFor the second improvement, I'm adding a concrete Python template to PROMPT.md that processes session data in a single pass, extracting key metrics like turn counts, tool call distributions, and narration ratios. This directly addresses the inefficiency of running multiple incremental scripts.\n\nBut I'm noticing that R33 already covers consolidating session metrics extraction into one comprehensive script, so I need to check whether this second improvement is actually distinct or if it's just restating what's already been identified.\n\nLooking at the distinction: R33 is about the *process* of consolidating multiple scripts into one, while my improvement provides the *actual template* showing how to do it. Since R33 doesn't include the specific script template, I think this is actionable enough to file separately—one is the goal, the other is the concrete implementation.\n\nI'll file both improvements and then move on to creating the beads. But first, I should check Step 1 of the instructions about closing any resolved improvements.\n\nNow I'm going through the 43 open improvements against session 22 data to see which ones can be resolved. Most of them don't have clear evidence in this session—R1 through R6 all involve scenarios that either didn't occur (pre-satisfied beads, missing files, parallel verification) or can't be evaluated from an analysis session. I'm keeping these open since I can't determine if they're actually resolved.\n\nR26 stands out because session 22 did use the Bash+python3 pattern for reading large .jsonl files, but it repeated the same approach seven times instead of consolidating it—so that improvement isn't resolved yet. R27 is also unresolved since the session still encountered invalid type errors. Most of the remaining improvements either involve coding sessions (which this analysis session isn't) or actions that simply didn't happen here, so I can't evaluate them.\n\nLooking at R31 about always including the --design flag, I can see that session 22's bd create calls did include it consistently across turns 27-29. But that doesn't necessarily mean the improvement is resolved—it could just be coincidence, or the prompt might already enforce it. Since R31 is still marked open, the prompt hasn't been formally updated yet, so the improvement is still pending.\n\nR32 about adding an Analysis Session workflow section to PROMPT.md wasn't addressed in session 22. R33 about consolidating metrics extraction into a single script also wasn't tackled—seven separate scripts ran instead. For R36, the improve list output showed all 43 improvements without truncation, which suggests that one might actually be resolved. But I need to verify whether the underlying issue in the code was actually fixed or if it just happened to work this time. wait - R36 says \"Remove head truncation from blacksmith improve list: use full output to see all improvements.\" This implies in PROMPT.md there's an instruction to use `blacksmith improve list | head -N`. If that was removed, we'd now see full output. And session 22 DID see all 43.\n\nHowever, I can't be certain R36 was resolved because maybe the improve list just naturally shows all 43 and there was never head truncation in this session. Without checking PROMPT.md, I can't confirm.\n\nR37: \"Analysis agents must skip Context Loading: add explicit skip note to Context Loading section\" - Session 22 DID skip Context Loading (no bd ready/claim calls). Good. But R37 is about adding the skip note to PROMPT.md. Not sure if PROMPT.md was updated.\n\nR38: \"Analysis agents must not read PROMPT.md\"\n\nNow looking at R39 through R41 - Session 22 violated R39 by including multiple narration turns after tool results instead of immediately following with another tool call or final answer. R40 is about clarifying how to check resolution, and R41 required emitting all bd creates in a single parallel turn, which Session 22 didn't do since it filed instead.\n\nR42 and R43 are also unresolved - Session 22 read MEMORY.md and had zero parallel tool calls.\n\nNone of these improvements appear to have actually fixed the issues they were targeting, so I'm not promoting any of them. And there's nothing worth dismissing either - they're all still valid concerns that need addressing.\n\nSo I'm moving forward with no promotions and no dismissals. Now I'll file two new improvements: one about Turn 1 requiring parallel tool calls with no narration, and another about adding a python3 one-pass session parse template to PROMPT.md. Then I'll create beads for each of these, running the improve and bead creation commands in parallel before committing
