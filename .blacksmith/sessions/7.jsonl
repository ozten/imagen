Violating them wastes 25-35% of your turn budget.\n\n### Rule A: ALWAYS batch independent tool calls in the SAME turn.\nEvery time you are about to call a tool, ask: \"Is there another independent call I can make at the same time?\" If yes, emit BOTH tool calls in the SAME message.\n\n**Mandatory parallel patterns — use these EVERY session:**\n- Session start: `bd ready` + `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` → ONE turn, TWO tool calls\n- Reading source + test: `Read foo.rs` + `Read foo_test.rs` → ONE turn\n- Multiple greps: `Grep(\"pattern1\")` + `Grep(\"pattern2\")` → ONE turn\n- Session end: `Bash(cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty)` + `Bash(cargo test --release)` → ONE turn (if they don't depend on each other's output)\n- Reading multiple related files: `Read config.rs` + `Read main.rs` → ONE turn\n\n**A session with ZERO parallel calls is a failure.** Target at least 5 turns with 2+ parallel calls per session.\n\n### Rule B: NEVER emit a text-only turn. Every assistant message MUST include at least one tool call.\nWRONG: \"Let me check the tests.\" (turn 1) → `Grep(tests/)` (turn 2)\nRIGHT: \"Let me check the tests.\" + `Grep(tests/)` (turn 1 — one message, includes both text AND tool call)\n\nIf you want to narrate what you're doing, include the narration AND the tool call in the same message. A text-only turn doubles your turn count for zero benefit.\n\n### Rule C: After closing your bead, EXIT IMMEDIATELY.\nDo NOT triage other beads. Do NOT run `bd ready` to find more work. Do NOT explore what to do next.\nThe sequence after closing is: `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin` -> run `blacksmith finish` -> STOP.\nEach session handles exactly ONE bead. The loop script handles picking the next one.\n\n---\n\n## Context Loading\n\nThe project architecture is documented in MEMORY.md — do NOT re-explore the codebase.\nOnly read files you are about to modify. Do NOT launch explore subagents (this means NO `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore`).\n\n1. Run `bd ready` AND `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` in the SAME turn (Rule A — two parallel tool calls)\n\n## Task Selection\nPick ONE task from the ready queue. **Always pick the highest-priority (lowest number) ready task.** Only deviate if recent `blacksmith progress list --bead-id <id>` entries explain why a specific lower-priority task should go next (e.g., it's a quick follow-up to the last session's work).\n\n**Remember Rule C**: You will work on exactly ONE task this session. After closing it, exit immediately.\n\n### Failed-Attempt Detection\nBefore claiming a task, run `bd show <id>` and check its notes for `[FAILED-ATTEMPT]` markers.\n\n- **0 prior failures**: Proceed normally.\n- **1 prior failure**: Proceed, but read the failure reason carefully. If the reason mentions \"too large\" or \"ran out of turns,\" consider whether you can realistically finish in 55 turns. If not, skip to the decomposition step below.\n- **2+ prior failures**: Do NOT attempt implementation. Instead, decompose the bead into smaller sub-beads:\n  1. Analyze the bead description and failure notes to understand why it keeps failing\n  2. Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\n  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\n  4. The next session will pick up the newly-unblocked child beads\n\nIf ALL top-priority ready beads have 2+ failures and you've decomposed them, move to the next priority level.\n\n### No Work Available\nIf `bd ready` returns no tasks, exit immediately:\n1. Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\n   - **Run the finish command**:\n     ```bash\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \"<brief description>\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\n     ```\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\n\n## Turn Budget (R1)\n\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\n\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n\n## Improvement Recording\n\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\n\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\n\n**When NOT to record:**\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\n\n**How to record:**","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"397c5f36-f128-4b77-a010-a60f51d1f542","uuid":"676b6cab-11c8-4bdb-97dd-41a133d36d42","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"AGENTS.md\nCargo.lock\nCargo.toml\nLICENSE\nPROMPT.md\nREADME.md\na-cat-1771959515.jpg\nclippy.toml\ndocs\nprd\nrustfmt.toml\nscripts\nsrc\ntarget\ntest_fixtures\ntests\n# Task Execution Instructions\n\n## CRITICAL: Execution Efficiency Rules (MUST FOLLOW)\n\nThese two rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n\n## Improvement Recording\n\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\n\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\n\n**When NOT to record:**\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\n\n**How to record:**","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false,"noOutputExpected":false}}

It looks like R1 and R2 were filed to address this gap but haven't been implemented.\n\nLooking at what \"pre-satisfied\" actually means: in session 5, all acceptance criteria were already implemented before the agent started. R2 is about the fast path where you skip implementation and go straight to verify. And R3 is about avoiding unnecessary clippy runs when no files were modified in these pre-satisfied scenarios.\n\n```\nFor R4, PROMPT.md currently assumes MEMORY.md exists at line 34, but there's no fallback if it's missing — the agent would just fail. Let me check if this was actually addressed in the sessions.\n```\n\nLooking at sessions 5 and 6, both were pre-satisfied for imagen-1xm. Session 5 detected this and ran verify, while session 6 added a test. The session data shows these were handled, but I need to verify whether the PROMPT.md instructions actually incorporate these improvements or if they're just happening implicitly.\n\nChecking each improvement: R1 isn't fully addressed — the verify section exists in normal flow but doesn't explicitly require it for pre-satisfied beads. R2 has no dedicated fast path in PROMPT.md yet. R3 still runs clippy unconditionally. R4 lacks graceful handling for missing MEMORY.md.\n\nLooking at session 6 metrics, the cache hit ratio is strong at 13.3:1, but the cost per session remains high at $1.28 for a pre-satisfied bead, suggesting there's still room to optimize token usage.\n\nThe session ran full test, clippy, and fmt checks even though the work was already pre-satisfied—this aligns with the gaps in R2 and R3 around skipping unnecessary verification steps. I'm now examining whether the ## Verify section handling is actually working as intended in the pre-satisfied path, or if that's another area where agents could be more efficient. Looking at the session metrics, I notice the cost was $1.28 for what amounted to just adding a test fixture—that's expensive for such a simple task. The high cache_read_tokens suggest a lot of context was loaded upfront, which makes sense given how long PROMPT.md is. Since there are already four open improvements and none resolved yet, I should focus on identifying genuinely new patterns rather than filing duplicates.\n\nOne pattern stands out: running the full `cargo test --release` suite when only adding a test fixture seems wasteful, since no production code changed. The issue is that `blacksmith finish` automatically runs quality gates including tests, so any optimization would require adding an exception to PROMPT.md. The value is there—saving around 60 seconds of test time—but the tractability depends on whether we can safely skip the full suite for fixture-only changes.\n\nLooking at the actual sessions, both 5 and 6 were on the same bead and both pre-satisfied, which suggests the agent's handling of pre-satisfied sessions isn't fully optimized. Session 5 detected it was pre-satisfied but didn't close it since there was no test fixture to add, while session 6 came back and added the fixture to complete the work. The real question is why session 5 didn't recognize it could close the bead without the fixture in the first place. Looking back at session 5 more carefully, the agent actually identified a legitimate gap—the implementation was complete but the test fixture (cassette file) was missing, so it correctly documented the blocker and left it for the next session rather than forcing a close. Session 6 then added that fixture and completed the bead, which is the right workflow.\n\nThe real question is whether there's a meaningful optimization here—262 seconds and $1.28 to create a cassette fixture is probably reasonable, and the two-session cost reflects a genuine dependency rather than inefficiency. I should think about what would actually improve this scenario. Looking at R1 more carefully, the real issue seems to be that the agent marked the bead as done without actually completing the verify step—it wrote a progress note before fixing the cassette fixture that was needed. This suggests the improvement should focus on enforcing that verify failures get resolved in the same session rather than being deferred.\n\nNow examining the session metrics themselves, the cache performance is strong with a 13:1 read-to-creation ratio, and the single session ran for 262 seconds at $1.28, which seems reasonable for the work involved. Let me dig deeper into what these numbers actually reveal about potential new improvements beyond R1-R4. adding a test fixture, this is high priority. Looking at the cost breakdown for this session—around $1.28 for 262 seconds—I'm noticing the output tokens account for roughly $0.72 of that, which suggests there might be some verbosity in the responses.\n\nI'm spotting a pattern here: even when a session only makes minimal changes like adding a YAML cassette fixture, the agent still runs the full expensive quality gates—the complete Rust test suite, clippy fixes, and formatting checks. That's overkill for such a small modification.\n\nI see that R3 already covers skipping clippy on pre-satisfied sessions, but the real bottleneck is the `cargo test --release` step. The challenge is that `blacksmith finish` automatically runs tests as quality gates, and I'm not sure if there's a flag to skip them when only fixture files were modified. Rather than trying to optimize around that uncertainty, I should focus on the most impactful improvements first.\n\nLooking at the four open improvements, none have been resolved yet, so I'll leave those as-is. For new patterns, I'm noticing something in session 5 with IMAGE-1xm: the agent correctly detected the bead was pre-satisfied but failed the verify step due to a missing cassette fixture. Instead of creating that fixture in the same session, it just wrote a progress entry and exited, leaving the actual fix for session 6.\n\nThe existing rule in PROMPT.md already says to fix verification failures before proceeding, but the agent didn't follow it. Since creating a test fixture is straightforward work that shouldn't be deferred, I should strengthen the prompt to explicitly say: when verify fails due to missing test fixtures or configuration files, complete that work in the current session rather than deferring it. This would save a full session cost and is genuinely new ground not covered by the existing improvements.

Still open.\n\nAll four improvements remain unimplemented. Now I'm looking at the Session 6 metrics to identify new patterns.\n\nSession 6 took 262 seconds and cost $1.28, with significant cache usage. The session focused on adding a test cassette fixture to complete the verification step for imagen-1xm. The agent created a minimal YAML cassette recording and ran tests, clippy, and formatting checks—all passed. This reveals a pattern where the cassette fixture could have been created in Session 5 when pre-satisfaction was detected, but instead came back in Session 6 as a separate task.\n\nThe root issue is that Session 5 identified all acceptance criteria were already implemented but didn't close because the ## Verify step couldn't pass without the cassette. This split the work across two sessions (~$2.56 total) instead of one. Rule R1 directly addresses this by requiring all ## Verify commands to pass before recording progress and closing, which would have forced either fixing the cassette immediately or deferring the done status entirely.\n\nNow examining Pattern B...\n\nSession 6 likely still ran clippy --fix despite only adding a YAML file, though R3 would prevent this and is already tracked. Pattern C shows the cache is performing well with a 13:1 hit ratio, which is efficient. For Pattern D, a single session with just a YAML file costs $1.28 mainly because of loading the 185-line PROMPT.md, running the full test suite with 51 tests, and executing clippy and fmt—the primary cost reduction levers are R3 to skip clippy and optimizing the test execution.\n\nSkipping cargo test entirely for pre-satisfied sessions would be risky since tests should always run, so R3's conservative approach of only skipping clippy makes sense. Looking at Pattern E, session 5 wrote \"All acceptance criteria were already implemented\" but didn't close, suggesting the progress entry was premature—if R1 were implemented, session 5 would have either closed successfully or left without a \"done\" entry. This wasted resources and left a misleading progress entry that session 6 had to re-read and re-confirm.\n\nA more direct fix would be: don't write a progress entry saying work is complete unless you're about to call `blacksmith finish` in the same session. This prevents the pattern of writing \"done\" and then exiting without closing. However, R1 already covers this by requiring verify to pass before recording progress and closing together, so this isn't genuinely new.\n\nWith only one session of data, it's hard to identify truly recurring patterns beyond what R1 and R3 already address.\n\nLooking at the actual session metrics, I notice the cache read tokens are massive—972K tokens, which is roughly 730 pages of text. The agent was reading a lot of context, and the total cost of $1.28 just for adding a YAML file and running tests seems high relative to the work done.\n\nThe 972K cache reads make sense for a multi-turn conversation where each turn re-sends cached context like PROMPT.md repeatedly, so that's actually efficient. But the 72K cache creation tokens is the real concern—that's a lot of new content for just adding a fixture, suggesting the agent either loaded large source files unnecessarily or generated lengthy responses.\n\nLooking at what likely caused this, the `cargo test --release` output for 51 tests is probably the culprit. Each test result gets added to the cache, inflating the token count significantly. I could reduce this by adding the `--quiet` flag to suppress verbose output, which would trim cache creation tokens without losing functionality. That's a modest improvement worth implementing.\n\nBut actually, verbose test output matters when debugging failures. A better approach would be to use `--quiet` by default in the happy path, then switch to full output only when tests fail and need investigation.\n\nThat feels minor though. The more impactful issue I'm seeing is that agents are deferring fixture creation to the next session when verify steps fail due to missing test artifacts like YAML files or JSON data. This wastes an entire additional session costing $1.28. I should add an explicit rule: if a verify step fails only because of missing non-Rust test files, create them immediately rather than deferring to the next session.\n\nThis is more targeted than R1's general guidance about fixing issues before proceeding—R1 prevents premature progress recording, but this new rule actively directs agents to handle fixture creation in the same session. They're complementary rather than redundant. If R1 were properly implemented, agents would run verify before recording done, see the fixture failure, and follow the existing \"fix before proceeding\" instruction, but making this explicit about fixtures could prevent the deferral pattern I'm observing. R1 + existing 4a should have prevented the problem, but both were effectively ignored in session 5. I think adding an explicit rule about creating missing fixtures inline would be useful — something that clarifies \"fix the issue\" means generating minimal test artifacts immediately rather than deferring to a new session.\n\nNow I'm looking at the cost breakdown from that session. The expensive parts are the quality gates — cargo test with 51 tests, clippy, and fmt — which consumed most of the $1.28. If I skip clippy when no Rust files changed, that saves some turns, but cargo test is still necessary. For fixture-only work in the future, I could narrow the test filter to run only relevant tests instead of the full suite.\n\nThe catch is that `blacksmith finish` runs the complete quality gates anyway, so there's no way around them entirely. This test-filtering approach is technically different from R3, but the tractability is questionable since it requires knowing which specific tests to run, which demands understanding the codebase structure.\n\nLooking at what I can actually file as new improvements: I need to avoid duplicating R1 through R4, and each new one needs a score of at least 6. The strongest candidate is creating missing test fixtures inline during pre-satisfied verify failures rather than deferring them—that directly tackles the two-session waste pattern and scores higher than the existing recommendations. There's also a minor optimization around using quieter test output to reduce token usage, though that's less impactful. Instead of listing each test result individually, `--quiet` would collapse that to a single summary line, saving roughly 10-20KB of tokens per session. That's a modest improvement with a score of 8, so I'll file improvement A as the priority and hold off on B given the backlog constraint. meaningful cache creation tokens, but it's a minor win. I'll just file improvement A since it has the clearest ROI—saving a full session costs $1.28. Let me check if any of the four open improvements are actually resolved or if there are beads for implementing them.

The improvements R1-R4 are being tracked with corresponding beads. The PROMPT.md edits haven't been made yet - they're in the bead queue for future sessions.\n\n\nNow I'm checking whether I should file new improvements or leave R1-R4 as-is. Since they all have corresponding beads that aren't resolved yet, I'll keep them open rather than promoting or dismissing them. Looking at R1 more closely, it actually already captures the cassette fixture issue in its description about skipping verify on pre-satisfied beads being a session failure when required test fixtures are missed.\n\nMy new pattern about creating missing fixtures immediately is related but more specific than R1's focus on preventing false \"done\" recordings. The real issue is that step 4a in PROMPT.md tells agents to fix verification failures, but session 5 bypassed this by taking an informal pre-satisfied path without hitting that formal step. If R2 gets implemented (adding the pre-satisfied check as step 2b that routes to step 4a), then agents would actually reach the fix-it instruction.\n\nLooking at session 6's metrics—262 seconds, $1.284 cost, only a YAML fixture created, 51 tests all passing—I'm not seeing anything genuinely new that R1 and R2 don't already address. The high cost is partly covered by R3, and the two-session pattern for one bead is what R1 and R2 are designed to fix. Since the instructions allow up to 3 improvements but don't require a minimum, I should probably hold off on filing anything else unless I find something truly novel.\n\nActually, there is one pattern worth considering: running the full test suite when only non-Rust files change seems wasteful. When session 6 added just a YAML fixture, all 51 tests ran unnecessarily. I could suggest optimizing to run targeted tests instead, though the constraint is that `blacksmith finish` runs tests automatically, so the agent can't easily skip them unless the rule explicitly allows it.\n\nBut wait—I'm realizing there's a bigger inefficiency here. The workflow runs `cargo test --release` manually first, then `blacksmith finish` runs the tests again automatically. That's a double test run for the same changes, which defeats the purpose of any optimization. Let me check what `blacksmith finish` actually does according to the documentation. parallel:\ncargo test --release\n# Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\ncargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\ncargo fmt --check\n```\n\nAnd then blacksmith finish runs tests again. This is a double-run! This seems like a genuine pattern.\n\nNew improvement: **Remove manual test/lint run before `blacksmith finish` - `blacksmith finish` handles quality gates**\n\nCurrently PROMPT.md instructs agents to run cargo test, clippy, fmt in step 4b, AND THEN call blacksmith finish which runs them again. This doubles the cost of quality gates.\n\nScore: Value=4 (saves double test runs = significant time), Tractability=3 = 12. This is high value!\n\nWait, but is this really true? Does `blacksmith finish` actually run tests? Let me re-read line 106.\n\n\"This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command. **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\"\n\nYes! `blacksmith finish` runs quality gates (check + test). So if agents also run cargo test manually in step 4b, they're running tests TWICE.\n\nWhy does step 4b exist then? Probably because running tests manually first lets you catch and fix issues before calling `blacksmith finish`, and running clippy --fix beforehand ensures clippy won't fail during finish. So step 4b is really a pre-check to catch problems early rather than discovering them when finish runs.\n\nThis is intentional defense in depth, not a problem. So I should scratch that.\n\nLooking at the session 6 data, I'm not finding genuinely new patterns beyond what R1-R4 already cover. All the issues observed are related to the pre-satisfied path, which those improvements are designed to address. I think the most honest answer is that there's nothing new to file beyond what's already tracked.\n\nBut wait—the instructions say I need to commit changes to `.beads/` after recording improvements. Let me check what actually changed in the git status to see if there's anything to commit.\n\nLooking back at the initial status, the `.beads/` database files were already modified from just accessing them, but I haven't filed any new improvements from this analysis. The real question is whether I should file improvement A about the fixture deferral pattern I noticed—where session 5 marked work as done without closing the bead, then session 6 came back and actually closed it.\n\nThe tricky part is that PROMPT.md requires adding a ## Verify section if one doesn't exist, but I'm not sure if that applies here since the bead was already closed by the cassette creation. I see the pattern now—session 5 hit the verify check, found the cassette missing, and correctly didn't close since the requirement couldn't be satisfied. Session 6 then created the fixture and completed the task. This actually aligns with the current rules, so implementing R1 and R2 together would've solved it in a single session by forcing the cassette creation before marking done.

The .beads/ files are modified. Let me now check if there's something worth filing as a new improvement.\n\nLooking at the session metrics:\n- 1 session, 262s, $1.28\n- Pre-satisfied bead (imagen-1xm) - needed a cassette fixture\n- Runs ran successfully\n\nAll the inefficiencies observed are covered by R1-R4. No new improvements are needed.\n\nLet me just commit the .beads/ changes and finish. The .beads/ files have been modified from reading (beads.db, daemon.log, last-touched are all modified). I should commit these.\n\n\nThe instructions say to commit after creating beads and recording improvements, but I haven't actually created any new beads or improvements—just analyzed existing ones. Still, the .beads/ directory itself changed from the analysis process (the database, WAL files, and metadata all got touched), so I should commit those changes.\n\nLooking at the prior commits, they're both labeled as analysis commits with the same pattern, which suggests this is the expected workflow. I'll commit the .beads/ changes but leave out .blacksmith/ since that's not part of the standard workflow.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2950,"cache_read_input_tokens":44545,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2950,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"397c5f36-f128-4b77-a010-a60f51d1f542","uuid":"e2832589-7c11-403c-9699-b8f7d0b4e47d"}

So agents who follow PROMPT.md step 4b (running tests + clippy + fmt manually) AND then call `blacksmith finish` ARE running tests twice. This seems like an inefficiency.\n\nHowever, this is intentional - step 4b lets agents catch issues before `blacksmith finish` commits. If tests fail in step 4b, the agent fixes them and tries again without generating a failed commit attempt. If `blacksmith finish` were the only gate, failed quality gates would just exit without committing, but the agent would have wasted turns running tests that were always going to fail.\n\n\nThis is a \"fail fast\" pattern - the early test run in step 4b catches issues for interactive debugging, while `blacksmith finish` serves as the final gate. In the happy path tests run twice, but in failure scenarios this saves many wasted turns. I've confirmed that R1-R4 remain open and relevant with no new patterns emerging from this session, so I'm ready to commit the .beads/ changes and wrap up.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":689,"cache_read_input_tokens":48246,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":689,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"397c5f36-f128-4b77-a010-a60f51d1f542","uuid":"10ee977a-17b5-4692-bda3-ab6b51dda238"}

All inefficiencies observed map directly to existing improvements:\n- 2-session waste for one pre-satisfied bead → **R1+R2** (verify before recording done + pre-satisfied fast path)\n- Running `cargo clippy --fix` on a YAML-only change → **R3**\n- No new patterns score ≥ 6 beyond what R1-R4 already cover\n\n**No new improvements to file.** Committing database state changes from the analysis reads:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":689,"cache_read_input_tokens":48246,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":689,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"397c5f36-f128-4b77-a010-a60f51d1f542","uuid":"1bab466a-4a0e-438c-ac1b-d04fa1fd8c7d"}
