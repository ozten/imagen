Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\n    52→  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\n    53→  4.

Bead-specific verification:**\n    77→   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n    78→\n    79→   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n    80→   ```bash\n    81→   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n    82→   ```\n    83→\n    84→   **4b.

Violating them wastes 25-35% of your turn budget.\n\n### Rule A: ALWAYS batch independent tool calls in the SAME turn.\nEvery time you are about to call a tool, ask: \"Is there another independent call I can make at the same time?\" If yes, emit BOTH tool calls in the SAME message.\n\n**Mandatory parallel patterns — use these EVERY session:**\n- Session start: `bd ready` + `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` → ONE turn, TWO tool calls\n- Reading source + test: `Read foo.rs` + `Read foo_test.rs` → ONE turn\n- Multiple greps: `Grep(\"pattern1\")` + `Grep(\"pattern2\")` → ONE turn\n- Session end: `Bash(cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty)` + `Bash(cargo test --release)` → ONE turn (if they don't depend on each other's output)\n- Reading multiple related files: `Read config.rs` + `Read main.rs` → ONE turn\n\n**A session with ZERO parallel calls is a failure.** Target at least 5 turns with 2+ parallel calls per session.\n\n### Rule B: NEVER emit a text-only turn. Every assistant message MUST include at least one tool call.\nWRONG: \"Let me check the tests.\" (turn 1) → `Grep(tests/)` (turn 2)\nRIGHT: \"Let me check the tests.\" + `Grep(tests/)` (turn 1 — one message, includes both text AND tool call)\n\nIf you want to narrate what you're doing, include the narration AND the tool call in the same message. A text-only turn doubles your turn count for zero benefit.\n\n### Rule C: After closing your bead, EXIT IMMEDIATELY.\nDo NOT triage other beads. Do NOT run `bd ready` to find more work. Do NOT explore what to do next.\nThe sequence after closing is: `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin` -> run `blacksmith finish` -> STOP.\nEach session handles exactly ONE bead. The loop script handles picking the next one.\n\n---\n\n## Context Loading\n\nThe project architecture is documented in MEMORY.md — do NOT re-explore the codebase.\nOnly read files you are about to modify. Do NOT launch explore subagents (this means NO `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore`).\n\n1. Run `bd ready` AND `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` in the SAME turn (Rule A — two parallel tool calls)\n\n## Task Selection\nPick ONE task from the ready queue. **Always pick the highest-priority (lowest number) ready task.** Only deviate if recent `blacksmith progress list --bead-id <id>` entries explain why a specific lower-priority task should go next (e.g., it's a quick follow-up to the last session's work).\n\n**Remember Rule C**: You will work on exactly ONE task this session. After closing it, exit immediately.\n\n### Failed-Attempt Detection\nBefore claiming a task, run `bd show <id>` and check its notes for `[FAILED-ATTEMPT]` markers.\n\n- **0 prior failures**: Proceed normally.\n- **1 prior failure**: Proceed, but read the failure reason carefully. If the reason mentions \"too large\" or \"ran out of turns,\" consider whether you can realistically finish in 55 turns. If not, skip to the decomposition step below.\n- **2+ prior failures**: Do NOT attempt implementation. Instead, decompose the bead into smaller sub-beads:\n  1. Analyze the bead description and failure notes to understand why it keeps failing\n  2. Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\n  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\n  4. The next session will pick up the newly-unblocked child beads\n\nIf ALL top-priority ready beads have 2+ failures and you've decomposed them, move to the next priority level.\n\n### No Work Available\nIf `bd ready` returns no tasks, exit immediately:\n1. Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\n   - **Run the finish command**:\n     ```bash\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \"<brief description>\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\n     ```\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\n\n## Turn Budget (R1)\n\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\n\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work.

If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue.

Bead-specific verification:**\\n    77→   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \\\"## Verify\\\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\\n    78→\\n    79→   If the bead has NO \\\"## Verify\\\" section, add one now:\\n    80→   ```bash\\n    81→   bd update bd-X --notes=\\\"## Verify\\\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\\\"\\n    82→   ```\\n    83→\\n    84→   **4b.

Do not repeat them.\\n    93→\\n    94→   **4c. Integration check:**\\n    95→   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\\n    96→\\n    97→5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\\n    98→   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\\n    99→     - What you completed this session\\n   100→     - Current state of the codebase\\n   101→     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\\n   102→   - **Run the finish command**:\\n   103→     ```bash\\n   104→     blacksmith finish bd-X \\\"<brief description>\\\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\\n   105→     ```\\n   106→     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\\n   107→     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\\n   108→   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\\n   109→   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\\n   110→\\n   111→## Turn Budget (R1)\\n   112→\\n   113→You have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\\n   114→\\n   115→- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\\n   116→- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\\n   117→- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\\n   118→- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\\n   119→\\n   120→If you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\\n   121→\\n   122→### Marking a Failed Attempt\\n   123→When bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\\n   124→```bash\\n   125→bd update <id> --status=open --notes=\\\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\\\"\\n   126→```\\n   127→Use a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\\n   128→\\n   129→## Stop Conditions\\n   130→- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\\n   131→- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\\n   132→- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\\n   133→- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\\n   134→\\n   135→## Improvement Recording\\n   136→\\n   137→Record institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session.

The loop script handles picking the next one.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Context Loading\\n\\nThe project architecture is documented in MEMORY.md — do NOT re-explore the codebase.\\nOnly read files you are about to modify. Do NOT launch explore subagents (this means NO `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore`).\\n\\n1. Run `bd ready` AND `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` in the SAME turn (Rule A — two parallel tool calls)\\n\\n## Task Selection\\nPick ONE task from the ready queue. **Always pick the highest-priority (lowest number) ready task.** Only deviate if recent `blacksmith progress list --bead-id <id>` entries explain why a specific lower-priority task should go next (e.g., it's a quick follow-up to the last session's work).\\n\\n**Remember Rule C**: You will work on exactly ONE task this session. After closing it, exit immediately.\\n\\n### Failed-Attempt Detection\\nBefore claiming a task, run `bd show <id>` and check its notes for `[FAILED-ATTEMPT]` markers.\\n\\n- **0 prior failures**: Proceed normally.\\n- **1 prior failure**: Proceed, but read the failure reason carefully. If the reason mentions \\\"too large\\\" or \\\"ran out of turns,\\\" consider whether you can realistically finish in 55 turns. If not, skip to the decomposition step below.\\n- **2+ prior failures**: Do NOT attempt implementation. Instead, decompose the bead into smaller sub-beads:\\n  1. Analyze the bead description and failure notes to understand why it keeps failing\\n  2. Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\\n  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\\n  4. The next session will pick up the newly-unblocked child beads\\n\\nIf ALL top-priority ready beads have 2+ failures and you've decomposed them, move to the next priority level.\\n\\n### No Work Available\\nIf `bd ready` returns no tasks, exit immediately:\\n1. Do NOT create any git commits\\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\\n\\n## Execution Protocol\\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\\n\\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\\n\\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\\n\\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\\n\\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\\n\\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \\\"## Verify\\\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\\n\\n   If the bead has NO \\\"## Verify\\\" section, add one now:\\n   ```bash\\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\\\"## Verify\\\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\\n   cargo test --release\\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\\n   cargo fmt --check\\n   ```\\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\\n\\n   **4c. Integration check:**\\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\\n\\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\\n     - What you completed this session\\n     - Current state of the codebase\\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\\n   - **Run the finish command**:\\n     ```bash\\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \\\"<brief description>\\\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\\n     ```\\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\\n\\n## Turn Budget (R1)\\n\\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\\n\\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\\n\\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\\n\\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\\n```bash\\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\\\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\\\"\\n```\\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\\n\\n## Stop Conditions\\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\\n\\n## Improvement Recording\\n\\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\\n\\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\\n\\n**When NOT to record:**\\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\\n\\n**How to record:**\\n```bash\\nblacksmith improve add \\\"Short descriptive title\\\" \\\\\\n  --category <workflow|cost|reliability|performance|code-quality> \\\\\\n  --body \\\"What you learned and why it matters\\\" \\\\\\n  --context \\\"Evidence: session number, file, or error message\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```bash\\nblacksmith improve add \\\"Always check Cargo.toml when adding new modules\\\" \\\\\\n  --category reliability \\\\\\n  --body \\\"New module files need their crate dependencies added to Cargo.toml. Cargo check catches this but only if run before bead closure.\\\" \\\\\\n  --context \\\"Session 50 closed a bead with uncompilable code because Cargo.toml was missing the fs2 dependency\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRecord improvements as you work — don't batch them to the end of the session.\\n\\n## Verification\\n\\nBefore closing a task, run these commands and ensure they pass:\\n\\n- test: `cargo test --release`\\n- lint: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`\\n- format: `cargo fmt --check`\\n\\n## Important\\n- Do not ask for clarification — make reasonable decisions\\n- Do NOT launch explore/research subagents (NO `Task` with `subagent_type: Explore`) — the architecture is in MEMORY.md\\n- Do NOT re-read files you already know from MEMORY.md\\n- Prefer small, atomic changes over large refactors\\n- Always run `cargo test --release` before committing\\n- Always run `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` then `cargo fmt --check` before committing — exactly ONCE each\\n- Always use `blacksmith finish` to close out — do NOT manually run git add/commit/push/bd close/bd sync\\n- **NEVER call `bd close` directly** — always go through `blacksmith finish` which enforces quality gates\\n- **EFFICIENCY**: Re-read Rules A, B, C above. Every text-only turn and every sequential-when-parallel tool call wastes your limited turn budget. Aim for 5+ parallel turns per session and 0 narration-only turns.\",\"numLines\":185,\"startLine\":1,\"totalLines\":185}}}\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

This suggests that either:\\n\\n\\n- Bead descriptions are too broad and get partially satisfied by dependent bead work, or\\n- Agents aren't recognizing when a bead is pre-satisfied and still spend turns verifying\\n\\nLooking at session 4's metrics, the high cache reads (785K) with low creation (29K) and a cost of $0.758 for what amounted to just adding a test fixture suggests the agent was pulling in lots of cached context but still burning tokens on a trivial task. I need to think about what concrete improvements would actually help here.\\n\\nThe main issue I'm seeing is that when a bead's criteria are already met, the agent still runs full verification instead of taking a faster path—that could save 20-30 turns in these cases and would be straightforward to implement with a PROMPT.md edit. The high cache read count is also worth investigating since it might mean the agent is loading more context than it actually needs. The agent's massive context reads suggest it's not following the \\\"only read files you're about to modify\\\" guideline, so I should add explicit rules to prevent unnecessary file loading. I'm identifying three concrete improvements: a fast path for pre-satisfied beads, stricter context minimization, and clearer guidance on skipping work when verification shows it's already done. Scoring these by impact and feasibility, the pre-satisfied bead fast path ranks highest at 16, followed by the pre-completed work rule at 12.\\n\\nNow I'm working through the exact PROMPT.md edits needed. For the fast path, I'd add guidance under the Execution Protocol to skip implementation entirely if acceptance criteria are already met—just run tests and finish. For context reduction, I need to clarify that the agent shouldn't load MEMORY.md or source files during the initial parallel status check, only after claiming a task. Let me refine these edits based on what's actually in PROMPT.md.\\n\\nLooking back at the rules, step 34 already says \\\"do NOT re-explore the codebase\\\" and \\\"Only read files you are about to modify\\\"—the issue is agents aren't following them, not that the rules are missing. And reviewing the token usage, those cache reads are actually the desired behavior since they're 10x cheaper than fresh reads. The high cost here is likely just from many turns with large cached context, which is expected for a session that only added one test fixture.\\n\\nI'm noticing a pattern across multiple sessions: the acceptance criteria are already met before any work starts. PROMPT.md doesn't address this scenario. I should add a pre-satisfied bead detection step right after understanding the requirements—if the criteria are already satisfied, skip straight to verification without reading implementation files or writing code. I'm also seeing agents run quality gates like `cargo test` and clippy multiple times even when the actual work was minimal, so I should add guidance to reduce those redundant runs. the pre-satisfied fast path, run `cargo test --release` ONCE only. Do not run clippy or fmt separately — `blacksmith finish` handles them.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Add a pre-flight check for trivial beads** (Score: 12)\\n   - When a bead has only a \\\"Verify\\\" section and no implementation needed, say so explicitly\\n   - Actually this is covered by improvement 1\\n\\nLet me settle on these 3 improvements and their exact PROMPT.md text:\\n\\n**Improvement A**: Add pre-satisfied bead fast path to Execution Protocol\\n**Improvement B**: Reduce context reads by not reading MEMORY.md if already loaded (the PROMPT.md says architecture is documented in MEMORY.md but doesn't say it's auto-loaded -- actually session context has it loaded)\\n**Improvement C**: Batch the verify commands into a single parallel turn\\n\\nNow I'm looking at what I can actually verify from the session data. Session 4 took 167 seconds and cost $0.758, with notably high cache creation tokens at 29,920, which suggests the agent was accumulating context each turn. The imagen-1xm bead had two progress entries, which is unusual — either the session needed a second attempt or there were separate sessions. Entry 5 marked everything as already satisfied, but entry 6 added a test fixture, indicating the first session found the work complete but something still needed to be done.\\n\\nThis pattern reveals a real problem: agents declare success without thorough verification, wasting sessions. When beads are actually pre-satisfied, agents still burn significant context loading. I'm settling on three concrete improvements: a fast path for pre-satisfied beads that skips unnecessary verification, reducing redundant context reads by tracking what's already loaded, and batching verification commands into a single parallel turn to cut down on round trips. Looking at the token usage metrics, that cache creation count seems unusually high for just adding a test fixture file—it suggests the agent may have been reading more files than necessary, which violates the constraint about only accessing files being modified. I'll finalize these three improvements and write out the specific PROMPT.md edits needed.\\n\\nFor the first improvement, I'm adding a rule that explicitly requires running the full verify section even when acceptance criteria appear already satisfied—the key is preventing premature progress entries before verification completes. The second improvement addresses the fast-path scenario by clarifying that if no code was written, only the release test run is needed before finishing. The third improvement reinforces the verification requirement as a final checkpoint before claiming completion.\\n\\nNow looking at the session data to identify other patterns—I notice one session had multiple progress entries for the same bead, which could indicate either a failed finish command or incomplete closure. I'm also examining the cost metrics and cache usage to understand the resource efficiency, though some of the pricing calculations appear incomplete in the data.\\n\\nGiven the constraint to file only the strongest improvements, I'm narrowing down to the two most impactful ones rather than forcing a third weaker suggestion. The first addresses the pre-satisfied bead verification issue, and I'm evaluating whether a second improvement around the inefficient output generation warrants inclusion based on its actual impact score. I'm drafting the exact wording for these three improvements to add to PROMPT.md—one clarifying that verify commands must actually run before closing, another adding an explicit pre-satisfied fast path that skips implementation entirely, and a third optimizing the quality gates step to avoid redundant checks when no files were

This suggests that either:\\n\\n\\n- Bead descriptions are too broad and get partially satisfied by dependent bead work, or\\n- Agents aren't recognizing when a bead is pre-satisfied and still spend turns verifying\\n\\nLooking at session 4's metrics, the high cache reads (785K) with low creation (29K) and a cost of $0.758 for what amounted to just adding a test fixture suggests the agent was pulling in lots of cached context but still burning tokens on a trivial task. I need to think about what concrete improvements would actually help here.\\n\\nThe main issue I'm seeing is that when a bead's criteria are already met, the agent still runs full verification instead of taking a faster path—that could save 20-30 turns in these cases and would be straightforward to implement with a PROMPT.md edit. The high cache read count is also worth investigating since it might mean the agent is loading more context than it actually needs. The agent's massive context reads suggest it's not following the \\\"only read files you're about to modify\\\" guideline, so I should add explicit rules to prevent unnecessary file loading. I'm identifying three concrete improvements: a fast path for pre-satisfied beads, stricter context minimization, and clearer guidance on skipping work when verification shows it's already done. Scoring these by impact and feasibility, the pre-satisfied bead fast path ranks highest at 16, followed by the pre-completed work rule at 12.\\n\\nNow I'm working through the exact PROMPT.md edits needed. For the fast path, I'd add guidance under the Execution Protocol to skip implementation entirely if acceptance criteria are already met—just run tests and finish. For context reduction, I need to clarify that the agent shouldn't load MEMORY.md or source files during the initial parallel status check, only after claiming a task. Let me refine these edits based on what's actually in PROMPT.md.\\n\\nLooking back at the rules, step 34 already says \\\"do NOT re-explore the codebase\\\" and \\\"Only read files you are about to modify\\\"—the issue is agents aren't following them, not that the rules are missing. And reviewing the token usage, those cache reads are actually the desired behavior since they're 10x cheaper than fresh reads. The high cost here is likely just from many turns with large cached context, which is expected for a session that only added one test fixture.\\n\\nI'm noticing a pattern across multiple sessions: the acceptance criteria are already met before any work starts. PROMPT.md doesn't address this scenario. I should add a pre-satisfied bead detection step right after understanding the requirements—if the criteria are already satisfied, skip straight to verification without reading implementation files or writing code. I'm also seeing agents run quality gates like `cargo test` and clippy multiple times even when the actual work was minimal, so I should add guidance to reduce those redundant runs. the pre-satisfied fast path, run `cargo test --release` ONCE only. Do not run clippy or fmt separately — `blacksmith finish` handles them.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Add a pre-flight check for trivial beads** (Score: 12)\\n   - When a bead has only a \\\"Verify\\\" section and no implementation needed, say so explicitly\\n   - Actually this is covered by improvement 1\\n\\nLet me settle on these 3 improvements and their exact PROMPT.md text:\\n\\n**Improvement A**: Add pre-satisfied bead fast path to Execution Protocol\\n**Improvement B**: Reduce context reads by not reading MEMORY.md if already loaded (the PROMPT.md says architecture is documented in MEMORY.md but doesn't say it's auto-loaded -- actually session context has it loaded)\\n**Improvement C**: Batch the verify commands into a single parallel turn\\n\\nNow I'm looking at what I can actually verify from the session data. Session 4 took 167 seconds and cost $0.758, with notably high cache creation tokens at 29,920, which suggests the agent was accumulating context each turn. The imagen-1xm bead had two progress entries, which is unusual — either the session needed a second attempt or there were separate sessions. Entry 5 marked everything as already satisfied, but entry 6 added a test fixture, indicating the first session found the work complete but something still needed to be done.\\n\\nThis pattern reveals a real problem: agents declare success without thorough verification, wasting sessions. When beads are actually pre-satisfied, agents still burn significant context loading. I'm settling on three concrete improvements: a fast path for pre-satisfied beads that skips unnecessary verification, reducing redundant context reads by tracking what's already loaded, and batching verification commands into a single parallel turn to cut down on round trips. Looking at the token usage metrics, that cache creation count seems unusually high for just adding a test fixture file—it suggests the agent may have been reading more files than necessary, which violates the constraint about only accessing files being modified. I'll finalize these three improvements and write out the specific PROMPT.md edits needed.\\n\\nFor the first improvement, I'm adding a rule that explicitly requires running the full verify section even when acceptance criteria appear already satisfied—the key is preventing premature progress entries before verification completes. The second improvement addresses the fast-path scenario by clarifying that if no code was written, only the release test run is needed before finishing. The third improvement reinforces the verification requirement as a final checkpoint before claiming completion.\\n\\nNow looking at the session data to identify other patterns—I notice one session had multiple progress entries for the same bead, which could indicate either a failed finish command or incomplete closure. I'm also examining the cost metrics and cache usage to understand the resource efficiency, though some of the pricing calculations appear incomplete in the data.\\n\\nGiven the constraint to file only the strongest improvements, I'm narrowing down to the two most impactful ones rather than forcing a third weaker suggestion. The first addresses the pre-satisfied bead verification issue, and I'm evaluating whether a second improvement around the inefficient output generation warrants inclusion based on its actual impact score. I'm drafting the exact wording for these three improvements to add to PROMPT.md—one clarifying that verify commands must actually run before closing, another adding an explicit pre-satisfied fast path that skips implementation entirely, and a third optimizing the quality gates step to avoid redundant checks when no files were

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01T9CHn5gXmExLATzWEx3EGv","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see what happened in session 5. The previous analysis agent (session 5) already filed the 3 improvements R1, R2, R3 based on session 4's data. Now I need to analyze session 5 to check if those patterns from session 4 still appear.\n\nLet me continue reading the session to understand what else happened and check if R1, R2, R3 were addressed in session 5.\n\nFrom the session 5 data I've read so far:\n- The analysis agent in session 5 found the same patterns from session 4 (pre-satisfied beads)\n- Session 5 filed R1, R2, R3 improvements\n\n\n- Session 5 ran for 164 seconds at a cost of $0.7088, and this is the same analysis session that filed those improvements.\n\nNow I need to determine whether R1, R2, R3 should be promoted or dismissed based on the current data, and whether any new improvements should be filed.\n\nSince R1, R2, R3 were just created in session 5 and this is the only session that's completed in this run, these improvements haven't had a chance to be addressed yet—they're brand new. I see that R1, R2, and R3 were just created in session 5 and haven't been addressed yet, so they shouldn't be closed. Looking at the session metrics, session 5 was an expensive analysis pass that spent multiple turns reading through progress entries to identify patterns rather than implementing fixes. I should verify whether these improvements are still valid issues and check if any new patterns have emerged that need filing. Looking at the evidence, R1, R2, and R3 were all just filed in session 5 and haven't been addressed yet since PROMPT.md hasn't been updated. I shouldn't promote any of them. What stands out from session 5 is that the agent made several sequential tool calls that could have been batched in parallel, violating Rule A—and this happened during what was supposed to be an analysis session, not even an active implementation phase. I'm realizing there's a distinction here—the analysis session has its own prompt separate from PROMPT.md, which is specifically for coding sessions. So when I'm looking at violations in session 5, like the sequential progress lookups and separate bash calls, those might not be fixable through PROMPT.md edits since that file doesn't govern the analysis agent's behavior.\n\nBut the task explicitly says every improvement must be a concrete PROMPT.md edit. So I need to reconsider whether these issues in the analysis session are actually relevant to file, or if I should focus on violations that would apply to the coding prompt instead. Looking at the progress entries more carefully, those pre-satisfied beads from sessions 4 and earlier are what R1, R2, R3 are actually addressing. For session 5 specifically, the analysis work revealed that even though it uses a different skill prompt, the sequential tool calls violated the parallel batching principle that should apply everywhere. I could strengthen PROMPT.md with an explicit requirement that all sessions—including analysis—batch their lookups together rather than spreading them across turns. at session-level analysis - filing improvements and creating beads. For coding sessions, I'd look for turn budget waste, redundant quality gate runs, or over-reading files. But I only have session 5 data which was itself an analysis session, so I need to examine the actual coding sessions 1-4 from the progress entries. Looking at those: most were quick completions, though session imagen-1xm is interesting because it initially claimed done but wasn't, then got fixed on the second attempt.\n\nThat's the core issue - the first imagen-1xm session said acceptance criteria were satisfied without actually verifying them, which is exactly what R1 is meant to prevent. I don't see strong evidence of patterns beyond R1-R3 from what I have, but I should check whether beads were actually created for each recommendation during that analysis session. Since PROMPT.md hasn't been updated yet and R1, R2, R3 are brand new filings from session 5, I shouldn't promote them. Looking at session 5's approach, the analysis agent made sequential tool calls across separate turns—reading PROMPT.md, then checking improvements, then running progress and ready commands in isolation—which violates the batching rule for analysis sessions, especially since PROMPT.md appears to contain task execution instructions that should apply broadly. Looking at those specific turns, lines 14 and 15 show separate commands that could've been combined into a single batch—this is a clear Rule A violation that the analysis agent missed. The real issue isn't that PROMPT.md lacks the rule, but that agents aren't consistently applying it in practice. Adding a concrete example for analysis workflows might help, though I'm realizing PROMPT.md already covers this fairly well, so the gap is more about execution than clarity.\n\nFor scoring improvements, batching progress lookups in analysis sessions would be straightforward to implement and enforce, but I need to be careful here—I'm currently running as session 5 itself, analyzing prior sessions 1-4 where the actual violations occurred. The improvements R1, R2, R3 already target those patterns, so promoting new ones without seeing those fixes applied first doesn't make sense. I should focus on what session 5's own efficiency reveals rather than filing additional improvements that might be redundant. I should be conservative about filing new improvements since R1, R2, and R3 are already tracking the main issues, and one session doesn't provide enough evidence for stronger changes. Let me check the git log and bead status to see what's actually been implemented and

The latest commit is \"c719f54 analysis: file process improvement beads\" - this means session 5 (the analysis session) already ran and committed the beads for R1, R2, R3.\n\n2. The open beads include:\n   - imagen-f9z: \"Enforce ## Verify section on pre-satisfied beads\" (implements R1)\n   - imagen-l17: \"Add pre-satisfied fast path step to Execution Protocol\" (implements R2)\n   - imagen-0dh: \"Skip clippy --fix on pre-satisfied no-modification sessions\" (implements R3)\n   \nThese are P1 priority items ready to work on, but PROMPT.md hasn't been updated yet since the beads are the actual work needed to address R1, R2, and R3. I'm running in a new session spawned by the coordinator, and based on the metrics showing session 5 completed in 164 seconds, I'm now analyzing what needs to happen next.\n\nSession 5 filed those three improvements but didn't resolve them. Looking back at session 5's execution, I'm spotting some inefficiencies: two sequential bash calls that could've run in parallel, a text-only turn that violated the rules, and a gap between reading PROMPT.md and running the improvement list command where those operations could've been combined.\n\nThe concerning part is that analysis sessions themselves are violating the same parallelization rules they're supposed to enforce. The cost difference between analysis and coding sessions is minimal ($0.71 vs $0.76), so the overhead isn't justified by efficiency gains.\n\nFor concrete improvements, I should focus on analysis-specific patterns. Running `blacksmith improve list` and `blacksmith progress list` together in one turn would save a turn, and batching multiple progress show calls would help too. That's worth a score of 12. I'm also thinking about reducing how much context gets loaded during analysis sessions, which could trim unnecessary overhead.\n\nBut I'm realizing the analysis agent actually does read PROMPT.md at the start, so adding analysis-specific examples there could genuinely help. The question is whether these improvements meet the filing threshold of 6 points and whether they're worth prioritizing among the top 3 candidates.\n\nLooking at session 5 more carefully, I notice it violated the parallelization rule—multiple sequential operations that could've run in parallel. That same inefficiency pattern shows up in both analysis and coding sessions, so it's worth addressing. I'll file an improvement focused on that specific violation rather than trying to promote the R1/R2/R3 patterns that haven't been tested yet. Looking at the JSONL structure more carefully, I see that lines 14 and 15 actually share the same message ID, meaning both tool calls come from a single assistant message—this is a Rule A violation with two sequential tool calls in one turn. I was wrong about the sequential calls—lines 14 and 15 actually share the same message ID, so they're parallel tool calls in a single assistant turn. Looking further, lines 18 and 20 also have the same message ID, confirming they're batched together too. The analysis agent did handle the parallelization correctly after all. Now I need to check line 28, which appears to be a text-only response without any tool calls. I'm weighing whether this single text-only turn in the analysis session is worth filing as a new improvement, especially given that R1/R2/R3 are already open and the constraint is at most 3 filings per run. The evidence is thin—just one minor pattern—and the other issues are already tracked, so I'm leaning toward not filing anything new right now. a maximum. If the evidence doesn't support strong new improvements, I should file fewer (or none).\n\nGiven:\n- Only 1 session in the metrics (session 5, which was itself an analysis session)\n- R1/R2/R3 already track the main patterns\n- The one text-only turn in session 5 is a minor issue (score 8, barely above threshold)\n\nI should be conservative. Let me think about whether there's anything else worth capturing from what I know about the project.\n\nLooking back at session 5, I can see the agent's workflow: it tried to read MEMORY.md first but that file doesn't exist, so it had to fall back to exploring the structure with `ls`. Then it read PROMPT.md, ran various blacksmith commands to check progress and improvements, and eventually did a text-only analysis before filing improvements. The real issue here is that PROMPT.md references MEMORY.md as the source of truth for project architecture, but since MEMORY.md doesn't exist, the agent wasted a turn trying to read it. This is worth noting as a pattern—either MEMORY.md needs to be created or PROMPT.md needs to stop referencing it.\n\nScoring this: it causes about 2 wasted turns per session (the failed read plus the fallback `ls`), so Value=4. The fix is straightforward—just update PROMPT.md to handle the missing file gracefully—so Tractability=3. That gives a score of 12, which is viable.\n\nBut actually, I should check whether AGENTS.md might already contain the architecture information that PROMPT.md is looking for. If it does, the fix could be even simpler: just update PROMPT.md to reference AGENTS.md instead of the nonexistent MEMORY.md.\n\nNow I'm looking at two concrete improvements I could make. The first is about eliminating unnecessary text-only turns in analysis sessions—when I'm ready to file improvements, I should emit the narration in the same turn as the first `blacksmith improve add` call rather than wasting a turn on just the summary. The second is the MEMORY.md issue: PROMPT.md claims architecture is documented there, but the file doesn't exist, so I should add a note saying to check AGENTS.md as a fallback if MEMORY.md isn't

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01H5Zfxafx3ZxLcQLhrPUHLp","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture of session 5. Let me also check what AGENTS.md says about MEMORY.md.\n\nFrom the AGENTS.md excerpt, it doesn't appear to reference MEMORY.md. The PROMPT.md says \"The project architecture is documented in MEMORY.md\" but that file doesn't exist in this project. Session 5 (and by the opening of the session log, this analysis session too) started by trying to read MEMORY.md, got a \"File does not exist\" error, then had to explore manually.\n\nNow let me look at the important observation: \n\n1. Session 5 (analysis) tried to read `/home/admin/.claude/projects/-home-admin-imagen/memory/MEMORY.md` - this failed\n\n\n2. Then it ran `ls /home/admin/imagen/` to explore\n\nSo there's a clear pattern here: PROMPT.md references a MEMORY.md file that doesn't actually exist, causing agents to waste a turn or two trying to read it before falling back to manual exploration. This adds unnecessary overhead to every session, costing about $0.05 per session in wasted API calls.\n\nThe fix is straightforward—just update PROMPT.md to check if MEMORY.md exists first, and if not, direct agents to check AGENTS.md or skip that step entirely. Though looking at what's actually in AGENTS.md, it only has quick reference commands, not the architecture documentation agents really need. The real problem is that the codebase architecture isn't documented anywhere accessible, so the improvement should at least add a conditional check to avoid the wasted exploration attempts. and falling back to exploring the codebase if needed.\n\nLooking at PROMPT.md more carefully, I see it documents the project architecture in MEMORY.md but doesn't explicitly instruct agents to read it first — yet they do anyway, wasting effort when the file doesn't exist. The real issue is that PROMPT.md references MEMORY.md without clarifying it may not exist in early project stages. I should update PROMPT.md to either remove the MEMORY.md reference or make it clear the file is optional, avoiding these failed read attempts.\n\nFor my decisions: R1, R2, and R3 shouldn't be promoted since they were just filed in the most recent session and PROMPT.md hasn't been updated yet. The implementation beads are still open and untouched, so I'll keep them as-is. The strongest pattern I'm seeing is this MEMORY.md context loading failure — agents consistently try to read a file that may not exist, which is worth documenting as an improvement. I'm recognizing that this recovery pattern—using an invalid `--type` flag—could've been prevented with better documentation in PROMPT.md about valid bd create types, but that's already covered in the help output so it's not worth duplicating. The stronger fix is handling the MEMORY.md case when it doesn't exist yet. I've been calling tools sequentially rather than batching them because the session file was too large, which mirrors the same issue I'm trying to address. Let me proceed with filing just the MEMORY.md improvement and leave the other rules as-is since they're already documented. I need to figure out the exact PROMPT.md change that would fix the MEMORY.md issue — agents are trying to read MEMORY.md immediately when it doesn't exist yet in early-stage projects, wasting turns before they can actually start work.\n\nThe fix is straightforward: add a conditional note right after the existing instruction about MEMORY.md, telling agents to skip it if it's not there and proceed directly to the next step instead of falling back to exploration or re-reading files.\n\nThis is a high-value, trivial change — saves a turn or two per new project session, and it's just a one-liner addition. I'll file this improvement and create the bead.","signature":"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
