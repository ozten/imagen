If the reason mentions \"too large\" or \"ran out of turns,\" consider whether you can realistically finish in 55 turns. If not, skip to the decomposition step below.\n- **2+ prior failures**: Do NOT attempt implementation. Instead, decompose the bead into smaller sub-beads:\n  1. Analyze the bead description and failure notes to understand why it keeps failing\n  2. Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\n  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\n  4. The next session will pick up the newly-unblocked child beads\n\nIf ALL top-priority ready beads have 2+ failures and you've decomposed them, move to the next priority level.\n\n### No Work Available\nIf `bd ready` returns no tasks, exit immediately:\n1. Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\n   - **Run the finish command**:\n     ```bash\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \"<brief description>\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\n     ```\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\n\n## Turn Budget (R1)\n\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\n\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n\n## Improvement Recording\n\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\n\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\n\n**When NOT to record:**\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\n\n**How to record:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Short descriptive title\" \\\n  --category <workflow|cost|reliability|performance|code-quality> \\\n  --body \"What you learned and why it matters\" \\\n  --context \"Evidence: session number, file, or error message\"\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Always check Cargo.toml when adding new modules\" \\\n  --category reliability \\\n  --body \"New module files need their crate dependencies added to Cargo.toml. Cargo check catches this but only if run before bead closure.\" \\\n  --context \"Session 50 closed a bead with uncompilable code because Cargo.toml was missing the fs2 dependency\"\n```\n\nRecord improvements as you work — don't batch them to the end of the session.\n\n## Verification\n\nBefore closing a task, run these commands and ensure they pass:\n\n- test: `cargo test --release`\n- lint: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`\n- format: `cargo fmt --check`\n\n## Important\n- Do not ask for clarification — make reasonable decisions\n- Do NOT launch explore/research subagents (NO `Task` with `subagent_type: Explore`) — the architecture is in MEMORY.md\n- Do NOT re-read files you already know from MEMORY.md\n- Prefer small, atomic changes over large refactors\n- Always run `cargo test --release` before committing\n- Always run `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` then `cargo fmt --check` before committing — exactly ONCE each\n- Always use `blacksmith finish` to close out — do NOT manually run git add/commit/push/bd close/bd sync\n- **NEVER call `bd close` directly** — always go through `blacksmith finish` which enforces quality gates\n- **EFFICIENCY**: Re-read Rules A, B, C above. Every text-only turn and every sequential-when-parallel tool call wastes your limited turn budget. Aim for 5+ parallel turns per session and 0 narration-only turns.","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61e8d025-4c85-4d48-ad54-31d3398764ee","uuid":"acc0ce5a-1c18-4b7f-b319-ec9b8c3fdf13","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"184\n# Task Execution Instructions\n\n## CRITICAL: Execution Efficiency Rules (MUST FOLLOW)\n\nThese two rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violating them wastes 25-35% of your turn budget.\n\n### Rule A: ALWAYS batch independent tool calls in the SAME turn.\nEvery time you are about to call a tool, ask: \"Is there another independent call I can make at the same time?\" If yes, emit BOTH tool calls in the SAME message.\n\n**Mandatory parallel patterns — use these EVERY session:**\n- Session start: `bd ready` + `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` → ONE turn, TWO tool calls\n- Reading source + test: `Read foo.rs` + `Read foo_test.rs` → ONE turn\n- Multiple greps: `Grep(\"pattern1\")` + `Grep(\"pattern2\")` → ONE turn\n- Session end: `Bash(cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty)` + `Bash(cargo test --release)` → ONE turn (if they don't depend on each other's output)\n- Reading multiple related files: `Read config.rs` + `Read main.rs` → ONE turn\n\n**A session with ZERO parallel calls is a failure.** Target at least 5 turns with 2+ parallel calls per session.\n\n### Rule B: NEVER emit a text-only turn. Every assistant message MUST include at least one tool call.\nWRONG: \"Let me check the tests.\" (turn 1) → `Grep(tests/)` (turn 2)\nRIGHT: \"Let me check the tests.\" + `Grep(tests/)` (turn 1 — one message, includes both text AND tool call)\n\nIf you want to narrate what you're doing, include the narration AND the tool call in the same message. A text-only turn doubles your turn count for zero benefit.\n\n### Rule C: After closing your bead, EXIT IMMEDIATELY.\nDo NOT triage other beads. Do NOT run `bd ready` to find more work. Do NOT explore what to do next.\nThe sequence after closing is: `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin` -> run `blacksmith finish` -> STOP.\nEach session handles exactly ONE bead. The loop script handles picking the next one.\n\n---\n\n## Context Loading\n\nThe project architecture is documented in MEMORY.md — do NOT re-explore the codebase.\nOnly read files you are about to modify. Do NOT launch explore subagents (this means NO `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore`).\n\n1. Run `bd ready` AND `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` in the SAME turn (Rule A — two parallel tool calls)\n\n## Task Selection\nPick ONE task from the ready queue. **Always pick the highest-priority (lowest number) ready task.** Only deviate if recent `blacksmith progress list --bead-id <id>` entries explain why a specific lower-priority task should go next (e.g., it's a quick follow-up to the last session's work).\n\n**Remember Rule C**: You will work on exactly ONE task this session. After closing it, exit immediately.\n\n### Failed-Attempt Detection\nBefore claiming a task, run `bd show <id>` and check its notes for `[FAILED-ATTEMPT]` markers.\n\n- **0 prior failures**: Proceed normally.\n- **1 prior failure**: Proceed, but read the failure reason carefully. If the reason mentions \"too large\" or \"ran out of turns,\" consider whether you can realistically finish in 55 turns. If not, skip to the decomposition step below.\n- **2+ prior failures**: Do NOT attempt implementation. Instead, decompose the bead into smaller sub-beads:\n  1. Analyze the bead description and failure notes to understand why it keeps failing\n  2. Break it into 2-5 smaller sub-beads (follow the break-down-issue workflow: create children, wire deps, make original blocked-by children)\n  3. Record decomposition with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id <id> --stdin`, then exit cleanly via `blacksmith finish`\n  4. The next session will pick up the newly-unblocked child beads\n\nIf ALL top-priority ready beads have 2+ failures and you've decomposed them, move to the next priority level.\n\n### No Work Available\nIf `bd ready` returns no tasks, exit immediately:\n1. Do NOT create any git commits\n2. Do NOT write a progress entry\n3. Simply exit — the harness will handle retry/shutdown\n\n## Execution Protocol\nFor the selected task (e.g., bd-X):\n\n1. **Claim**: `bd update bd-X --status in_progress`\n\n2. **Understand**: Run `bd show bd-X` for full task description. If the task references a PRD section, read it with an offset (see PRD index in AGENTS.md).\n\n3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully\n   - Only read files you need to modify — architecture is in MEMORY.md\n   - Follow existing code patterns (see MEMORY.md for architecture and testing conventions)\n\n4. **Verify** (use parallel calls per Rule A):\n\n   **4a. Bead-specific verification:**\n   Run `bd show bd-X` and look for a \"## Verify\" section in the description. If it exists, execute those exact steps. If any verification step fails, fix the issue before proceeding.\n\n   If the bead has NO \"## Verify\" section, add one now:\n   ```bash\n   bd update bd-X --notes=\"## Verify\\n- Run: <command you used to test>\\n- Expect: <what you observed>\"\n   ```\n\n   **4b. Code quality gates:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite FIRST, then lint in parallel:\n   cargo test --release\n   # Then in ONE turn with TWO parallel Bash calls:\n   cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty\n   cargo fmt --check\n   ```\n   Run lint and format exactly ONCE each. Do not repeat them.\n\n   **4c. Integration check:**\n   Before closing, verify your changes don't break existing callers. Grep for the function/struct names you changed or renamed. If other code references them, confirm those references still work.\n\n5. **Finish** — record progress and call `blacksmith finish`, then STOP (Rule C):\n   - **Write a progress entry** with `blacksmith progress add --bead-id bd-X --stdin` and include a short handoff note:\n     - What you completed this session\n     - Current state of the codebase\n     - Suggested next tasks for the next session\n   - **Run the finish command**:\n     ```bash\n     blacksmith finish bd-X \"<brief description>\" src/file1.rs src/file2.rs\n     ```\n     This runs quality gates (check + test), verifies bead deliverables, then handles: staging, committing, bd close, bd sync, auto-committing .beads/, recording bead closure metadata, and git push — all in one command.\n     **If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.** Fix the issues and re-run.\n   - If no specific files to stage, omit the file list and it will stage all tracked modified files.\n   - **After `blacksmith finish` completes, STOP. Do not triage more work. Do not run bd ready. Session is done.**\n\n## Turn Budget (R1)\n\nYou have a **hard budget of 80 assistant turns** per session. Track your turn count.\n\n- **Turns 1-55**: Normal implementation. Write code, run targeted tests (`--filter`).\n- **Turns 56-65**: **Wrap-up phase.** Stop new feature work. Run the full test suite + `lint:fix` + `analyze`. If passing, commit and close.\n- **Turns 66-75**: **Emergency wrap-up.** If tests/lint are failing, make minimal fixes. If you can't fix in 10 turns, revert your changes (`git checkout -- .`), mark the failure (see below), record a progress entry, and exit cleanly.\n- **Turn 76+**: **Hard stop.** Do NOT start any new work. If you haven't committed yet: revert, mark the failure, record a progress entry, and exit immediately. An uncommitted session is worse than a cleanly abandoned one.\n\nIf you realize before turn 40 that the task is too large to complete in the remaining budget, STOP immediately. Mark the failure, and exit. Do not burn 40 more turns on a doomed session.\n\n### Marking a Failed Attempt\nWhen bailing out of a task for any reason, always run:\n```bash\nbd update <id> --status=open --notes=\"[FAILED-ATTEMPT] <YYYY-MM-DD> <reason>\"\n```\nUse a specific reason: `too-large`, `tests-failing`, `lint-unfixable`, `missing-dependency`, `context-overflow`, or a brief custom description. This marker is read by future sessions to detect beads that need decomposition (see Task Selection).\n\n## Stop Conditions\n- Complete exactly ONE task per iteration, then STOP (Rule C)\n- After calling `blacksmith finish`, do NOT continue. Do NOT triage. Do NOT run bd ready again.\n- If task cannot be completed, mark the failure (see above), record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\n- If tests fail, debug and fix within this iteration\n\n## Improvement Recording\n\nRecord institutional lessons using `blacksmith improve add` when you encounter reusable insights during your session. This builds the project's knowledge base so future sessions avoid repeated mistakes and adopt proven patterns.\n\n**When to record** (pick at most 2 per session — don't spend turns on this):\n- You discover a non-obvious debugging technique or root cause\n- You find a code pattern that should be followed (or avoided) project-wide\n- You notice a workflow inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary file reads, redundant test runs)\n- A test failure reveals a subtle invariant that isn't documented\n\n**When NOT to record:**\n- Routine task completion (closing a bead is not an insight)\n- Obvious things already in MEMORY.md or PROMPT.md\n- Session-specific context that won't help future sessions\n\n**How to record:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Short descriptive title\" \\\n  --category <workflow|cost|reliability|performance|code-quality> \\\n  --body \"What you learned and why it matters\" \\\n  --context \"Evidence: session number, file, or error message\"\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nblacksmith improve add \"Always check Cargo.toml when adding new modules\" \\\n  --category reliability \\\n  --body \"New module files need their crate dependencies added to Cargo.toml.

Let me analyze what I found:\n\n**Session 12 (session file 11.jsonl) metrics:**\n- 32 assistant turns\n- 10 text-only turns (31.25% ratio - massive Rule B violation)\n- 0 parallel turns (complete Rule A violation)\n- Duration: 282 seconds\n- Cost: $1.05\n\nThis is the analysis agent session itself. The pattern of 0 parallel turns and high text-only turn ratio persists even in the analysis agent.\n\n**Key findings from metrics analysis:**\n\n1. **Rule A (parallel calls) is consistently being ignored**: 0 parallel turns in session 12. \n\nLooking across all prior sessions, they also had 0 parallel turns—this is a systemic problem, not an isolated incident.\n\n2. **Rule B (text-only turns) violations remain high**: 10/32 = 31% text-only ratio in session 12, consistent with the 25-34% range I'm seeing across earlier sessions.\n\n3. **Analysis agent itself violates the rules it's analyzing**: The self-improvement analysis agent is spending turns narrating analysis before acting, when it could narrate and call tools simultaneously.\n\nNow let me check if any of the existing open improvements should be closed:\n\nLooking at the recent session (session 12):\n- **R4** (\n\nhandle missing MEMORY.md gracefully): The agent tried to read `/home/admin/.claude/projects/-home-admin-imagen/memory/MEMORY.md` and got \"File does not exist\"—still happening, not resolved.\n- **R7** (Fix broken session-start parallel example): The session still shows sequential tool calls at start—not resolved in PROMPT.md.\n- **R1** through **R17**: None of these edits appear in PROMPT.md yet.\n\nSince PROMPT.md hasn't been edited, none of the improvements have been resolved.\n\nLooking at the current session (12), the most persistent issue is the high text-only turn ratio at 31%, which R15 and R12 are supposed to address.\n\nThe 0 parallel turns are already covered by R13, R14, R5, and R9, so that's not a new problem to file. The analysis agent itself is violating the rules, but that's also covered by existing improvements. The $1.05 cost for 282 seconds seems high for what was accomplished, though.\n\nExamining what session 12 actually did—reading PROMPT.md, running bash commands, generating 10 text-only turns—most of this is already captured by existing improvements. The real pattern I'm noticing is that the self-improvement sessions themselves are becoming wasteful.\n\nLooking at the data more carefully, the analysis agent read PROMPT.md and filed improvements for the coding sessions, but PROMPT.md itself hasn't been modified yet despite all these analysis sessions having 0 parallel turns. The issue is that both the analysis sessions and the coding sessions are stuck with the same constraint, so the improvements aren't actually being applied.\n\nNow I'm seeing that improvements R1-R17 have been filed but none have been implemented as actual edits to PROMPT.md. The beads are piling up without being worked on, which suggests the real problem might be batching these improvements into fewer, higher-priority beads rather than creating separate ones for each suggestion. Looking at the specific improvements listed, many of them do target PROMPT.md directly, so I need to figure out which ones are genuinely new versus which ones are already covered. fast path: skip implementation\n- R3: Skip clippy on pre-satisfied sessions\n- R4: Handle missing MEMORY.md gracefully\n- R5: Batch verify commands in parallel\n- R6: Include error text in failed-attempt notes\n- R7: Fix broken session-start parallel example\n- R9: Add context-loading step 1b\n- R10: Fix Rule A: remove wrong cargo clippy+test parallel example\n- R11: Fix step 4b: sequential not parallel\n- R12: Add turn-10 parallel checkpoint\n- R13: Batch implementation file reads\n- R14: Merge Claim and Understand steps\n- R15: Add Rule B inline reminders\n- R16: Remove redundant final Verification section\n- R17: Fix stale lint:fix and analyze commands\n\nThese cover most patterns I can see. Now looking at session 12 specifically, I notice the analysis agent isn't actually closing improvements even though the prompt tells it to check whether recent metrics show they're fixed—it's just leaving them open indefinitely. The agent also tried to read MEMORY.md at a path that doesn't exist, which R4 should address, and despite having R12-R15 open, the session still shows no parallel calls and only text-only turns. This suggests improvements might need a decision rule for when to escalate or close them if the underlying problem persists across multiple sessions. running and filing improvements, but the PROMPT.md itself isn't getting updated—either the filed improvements aren't being worked on, or the analysis agent is creating duplicates that clog the queue. Let me think about what new improvements might actually be worth filing, like whether the analysis agent is generating too many improvements per session.\n\nLooking at the recent session data, I can see session 12 filed five improvements (R13-R17), but the rule explicitly states a maximum of three per run. That's a violation of its own instructions, which is a real problem—it wastes time and creates unnecessary duplicates. This would score well on both value and tractability, so it's worth flagging.\n\nNow I'm noticing the PROMPT.md itself has grown to 184 lines with all these open improvements that never get implemented. There's a meta-issue here where improvements keep getting filed but nobody's actually picking them up to act on them. I could suggest adding a rule that when there are more than 10 open improvements, the priority should shift to implementing those before filing new ones.\n\nI'm also looking back at the Rule A examples in PROMPT.md, specifically the cargo clippy and cargo test case that was cited as problematic in R10. The current text shows them running in parallel as a single turn, but that's exactly what was flagged as wrong.\n\nLooking at the Turn Budget section, I see references to `lint:fix` and `analyze` commands that don't actually exist in this Rust project—that's already covered by R17 so no new issue there.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the analysis agent itself is violating Rule B right now with ten text-only turns and zero parallel turns, which suggests the agent's own instructions might be the limiting factor.\n\nBut actually, the analysis agent is using this same system prompt I'm reading, while PROMPT.md is what governs the coding agents. So I should focus on finding new patterns specifically in the coding sessions.\n\nLooking at the session data, all the coding sessions show zero parallel turns, which R9, R13, and R14 already address. Let me dig deeper into PROMPT.md to see what's genuinely not covered yet.\n\nThe \"Turn Budget\" section mentions `lint:fix` and `analyze` commands, which R17 already handles as stale commands. The \"Important\" section correctly states the cargo clippy and fmt requirements. The \"Verification\" section seems redundant with step 4 and should probably be removed per R16.\n\nWhat I'm noticing in session 12 is a lot of text-only \"Analysis\" commentary turns where the agent writes lengthy analysis before calling tools—this suggests Rule B reminders aren't landing strongly enough, even though R15 already calls for inline reminders at the steps.\n\nThe analysis sessions themselves are expensive (~$1.05 each) and generate duplicates, but that's more of an issue with the analysis agent's own prompt than PROMPT.md.\n\nLooking for genuinely new improvements that aren't covered by R1-R17 and have evidence from session 12, I'm noticing a structural inconsistency: Step 4b says to run the full test suite first, then run clippy and fmt in parallel, but the instructions seem to contradict this ordering.\n\nActually, re-reading R11 more carefully—it flags that clippy --fix and fmt --check should be sequential because clippy modifies formatting, so fmt --check would fail if run in parallel. The order needs to be: test → clippy --fix → fmt --check.\n\nNow I'm noticing something else: none of these improvements have actually been implemented yet. The beads exist but the coding sessions aren't picking them up. Let me trace through what's actually happening in the current PROMPT.md to see if there are other open issues I'm

But the recent sessions (6-11) have ALL been analysis sessions, not coding sessions.\n\nThis is a key insight: the loop has been running analysis sessions continuously without any coding sessions to implement the improvements. The coding sessions (imagen-5h1, etc.) are blocked by other work (imagen-vux), but the PROMPT.md fix beads (imagen-f9z through imagen-t3q) are all P1 and should be ready to pick up.\n \nLooking at the task list, these P1 PROMPT.md fixes appear unblocked and should be getting picked up, yet only one session has actually run so far in this analysis window, and it was an analysis session rather than a coding one.\n\nChecking the session history, I see sessions 0-4 were coding sessions that closed some beads, but then sessions 6-11 have all been analysis sessions. The loop keeps generating improvements and creating new beads, but no coding sessions are running to actually implement them—that's the core problem here.\n\nI need to look at the blacksmith loop configuration to understand why it's stuck in this analysis-only pattern.","signature":"EpkRCkYICxgCKkAK/sCb8E0K5ylxyKYxDezdnojN9yrQ+BgP14mJbLqNi+3+7UbB1dPhurdU+/KCIL6FrNQ5VzlaS3n/J1NLl9JBEgy00/fBCmhSWxeNE6oaDId+RAc2ckNwE03EgyIwMqEFahcKuO9ctapAML4JUBtnIvhJaA4wDOjD8QyXdbcBp7bFAEhpiKYN2BDWGhU1KoAQF+0fE4S52EBT0jh2akjE4Ds3sxCCI/23vHZfveD5qH8NpNlZ3Vune3YFodCXqOm9nnRbr0oHTPjlta1VrDMk2XqtoicqRvr2ManU4Vn4CHvH5g/+QaXfcPaLFTHVyNZria1ouATjkDDQUVr3HjuAkwLlCi8tbCtsvmCklHfrGZE8KjABhQVHKQMIkUOWgjPqEMMsSDnex3pFflN27ImeyHb6zN9bUUC+JDAXfR49eyCsZ7vm9iYVSxh1pJDRbaE7b77iFoFLuoGLLLmZjOM3ZQ1BpQfjZC3WOWvoJj5dOpJVJ7650fYWpUzmBO/O9cYXaQAdifhBFyyNMfp8Rs2r856HwWrr0KdrBmlCst0BQfAWr3TzjDOYOpx7IZEWCnPXnbw9pqUHhm93/ETcaV9Z/WEABkz3qkFbmAZpQhb4Za3nCCZwDr6wmdHYGVhwR1/vuFymxqzeAnCoNIO7VszX29+JAgkn38LcIk1WWBcoJbbjZc2lzY1btK1oySS3SMWYxRYbcVs8dQsGIU2lLx+acFJXu7BOIY2pF1rBv9xR5nJrjg9HGqdlh8DxvAx6tcyTzJtfuUdK4okKgVjyxWZP6foZA1uWV2a8A0INhH1xAkcf0xdUagmj3n0xS52O7Il7XzlpdI6QQAnh0M8RiCUDZ4Zimphk8twV3DUTR8e3z3snaRQxlK8dRR7Px1wFDLMLBmsjIfam1G6M2m46URt7LrO6JW5TAiaK11BMPyYDUI+ht4wmpcRaDQBVgL16m9pIwMNQWfzkC8kxpRKmPdHfY3BNBFA45WTfJEjk7pNum7AVKEmIOkeZvY+++XBXugtMZRFlKY19U8qmqje+GYczqYxLYz3UWZvJD+1HluU4ow2BL7tjbRZKx54zgxahfCTLBiVPDJI5QA58B/0vJsVj8KiJr9Gun63Aw6ndC5P/erl+DX9vGdbRRQQumN+67sXyYqzzUAuNnas+3x1hM1pGAeu0/ymcHx2V50/WjfQ5WbK/uVQRhoGxl3IlLYI1JWlVtjLzWudvM0c9L8d43qdwax2ruqt94hPxyjcrcBDV62KjAKEYBw6i5tBzLVihEeYR38xazbuslTFPIU2Bo0zK5A+BzVJhdYMUn88DV53V5q82cragGKmnk7leFg4Ad1h2+xYEK8/iI8Ib/lSrY5VsxPDe7k1WRrwCI4CshCmbLu3xZiKsBU2hqCDOR8FWvwbeG8CyUqZG7ylKxndJ0GcLpnKT19j4wnidW1qDxxLbcDKaI/0ruiEiVLZJVRzJl9GmYffHCY4ILo+IBZWGVms1Q8MOXE3Hzs9TFNlozNVzugx/CJqcCzg2cFRBFORw3/9rNc53Yov6JkTjO4vOPHsl6mqMWfcuUHtc6gvlYJMBgAJbFJ1RyHnr4kRlVgSP/ITTRtA0+t5hwRHgFOndudwHfbuVtIvgxIv/+zomSt3jjKXuLUW6+WQtmgge/pxkd2T+y/KlQdC3t0U7mk4hV0peGJl6XskgfrdwyajNLtXPDZ+j7Vxk6v/MIyUW+QeFEZyN7ugUQd6IAAa7P2LjnOo62ee3banLbkXgbB5RUHS6Z94YHo5pLxq0YtOLNVnhnH/7boJDN5UdclwTIBU9PwuYcB8dJpjzKL1IB+vdM/cr0NNzB65/LxojigTKcILFu487qDpx+AJcAIKO4ejY83UO7RDw2xha+P/DIYPyNl25+ICOKcEEx+u0whvgkUyzyvcIIp7pWMNHimsoQ9GaAdh8Il546EZqUA1VMIXoVTtDCYj6oXM5xwYia/faEmpCBW62Hgc2zI42SoUGq0xReDcutLAae6SdsGpZyNIfFcftJS0NjqeHwrrT7bdIy4cTdBI+k8+Kvzx7ks9UDGFGvJEOlferEu0OrafWP/aidWbqnpgxwGM2hisavAJv3NgVu/99sbFk1qxgFBzqUzKVC5aE8ng1S+sKrLRDOU7Ex6iGM6zg5uDWalNutq+OEBucBgLTJTXIToYEDL7jFngmEQERq7zUuJhI0SvKSf49CV/kNNFHuHZS/hMNKMoKf4IqIwkA3mpD5tFxVpiQjkq4TvPKw2bQC9aKW7cvcDQzoFceB3VTvSY2wEZn1PA9EJef4UMlEdjeA7bPE1XNhObkn+AvG/RQe8CjbudNOJExclz/9aFDqvZSw2aXirky0u7GFd53lLFZYPj+An+/zJzM8wdRrLldYa6MPwm6PwBM+Dtt1xOkREBT3ixzPFI0OYvYLRLNyFBhazYmx7wVx2OZeq+XEuixeckrZ0TbyxK5f9VtXs9kZHB0L1JrpkzqAJfONDDg5G1eidVcN4cWJIa0m3hIDFO0QXm3v2rrbW6D5QqjoFt11whT/FI4EUYhUUezaBqHa2JYH9rtw3LMgxCwdeIO+nPPFPKEk2xkKPzwb3a8ZU/O+SGYFPi0koboPNnG5Fh1jAy2umT7yBmRBiE9M2Zp6e1dzW8uUjh7I7IHhVB3WE55HhIUJXaVe98H2fDORu8CJfgjN3Nsnu/5kpz1bAjiWAWBE5K6IjVSDhbCUS+iJ8/wAgLwSLIIdqWKe0Uf9kdce+zOJ7YCa6fcFZRbiCygLMFm4CHYtZ13n3xp8LfJOxAuHcMfmOUovwMbH3kJl3ac7cGaC7ZF7u0I/V4kAZUlaB2rOSq4YhiRMH9+aGwsm5TYBZNCi6MIka8SgT7vqy/qFmKgiYUIrW8TC87gviYDDKkJZLdV1TO9rAYoDXvj5PYYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4875,"cache_read_input_tokens":39096,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4875,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61e8d025-4c85-4d48-ad54-31d3398764ee","uuid":"2d1383e5-73b2-4a49-9a28-a941871d5c9d"}

That's 9 consecutive analysis sessions without a single coding session. The PROMPT.md fix beads are piling up unimplemented.\n\nThis is the key pattern: The loop keeps spawning analysis sessions without any coding sessions to implement the improvements. \n\nThe improvements accumulate but nobody's implementing them. I see 17 open P1 PROMPT.md fix beads ready for coding, yet the blacksmith loop keeps triggering analysis sessions instead—9 in a row with no coding in between. I need to figure out why the loop is stuck in this analysis-only cycle.\n\nLooking at the session counter, I'm in session 14 now. The pattern is clear: improvements keep getting re-analyzed without being implemented, which wastes resources and compounds the problem. This feels like something worth filing as an improvement itself, though it's tricky since PROMPT.md governs the coding agent, not the analysis agent that's stuck in this loop.\n\nScanning the coding sessions for actionable patterns I can actually address through PROMPT.md edits—the analysis sessions don't follow those rules anyway, so they won't help me here.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1369,"cache_read_input_tokens":43971,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1369,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61e8d025-4c85-4d48-ad54-31d3398764ee","uuid":"c6c2ee0c-e6df-4f72-b99a-69a3aa3051e2"}

This is likely the current session I'm running right now. Let me focus on what I need to do:\n\n**Step 1: Check if any improvements should be promoted/dismissed**\n\nGiven that:\n- ALL open improvements (R1-R17) are still open\n- No coding sessions have run after session 4 (all recent sessions 5-13 are analysis)\n- The improvement beads (imagen-f9z through imagen-t3q) exist and are P1 but haven't been worked on\n\nNone of the improvements have been resolved. \n\nI shouldn't promote any of them. But I should check if any can be dismissed as irrelevant or wrong. Looking through each improvement, they all still seem relevant—R1 through R7 all address real issues that have shown up in the session data, like missing MEMORY.md files and the need for better error handling and verification steps.\n\nContinuing through the rest, R8 through R17 are also still relevant. They cover fixes to the PROMPT.md documentation, parallel execution issues, and structural improvements to the workflow that the session data shows are needed.\n\nLooking at what's actually happening versus what the improvements target, I notice the zero parallel turns across all sessions persists even with explicit instructions in place—this suggests the problem might need stronger enforcement than just documentation updates. The analysis sessions running repeatedly without coding breaks is outside the current scope, and the cost per analysis session is climbing with diminishing returns since the same improvements keep getting re-analyzed.\n\nScanning through PROMPT.md for gaps where parallel execution could be enforced but isn't yet instructed, I see the existing examples cover concurrent reads and multi-grep operations, but the \"Claim\" and \"Understand\" steps are still sequential—merging those two steps could unlock parallel behavior without requiring new instructions elsewhere.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice the Turn Budget section references `lint:fix` and `analyze` commands that don't actually exist in a Rust project, which R17 already flags as an issue. And the \"Important\" section at the end mentions running `cargo clippy --fix` but the exact context cuts off—I need to see what follows to understand if there's a new pattern emerging there. The contradiction between step 4b (parallel execution) and the Important section (sequential with \"then\") is the real issue, and R11 would resolve it by making step 4b sequential. Looking at the actual coding beads ready to go, I see seventeen PROMPT.md fix tasks from imagen-f9z through imagen-t3q that are all open and priority 1, but the bd ready command keeps returning analysis sessions instead of coding ones, which suggests there might be a filtering problem.\n\nThe analysis sessions I'm seeing have 21-45 turns each, and the recent one had 23 turns with only text output and no parallel calls—the analysis agent itself doesn't enforce the parallel execution rules, so it's also burning through turns inefficiently. That's a system prompt issue for the analysis agent, not PROMPT.md.\n\nLet me focus on what concrete, evidence-backed improvements I can actually propose for PROMPT.md that aren't already covered by R1-R17 and score at least 6. The coding sessions all start with zero parallel turns in their first turn, which suggests adding a self-check at session start might help.\n\nLooking at PROMPT.md's Step 1, it says to run `bd ready` AND `blacksmith progress show` in the same turn, but R7 flags this as wrong—you need `bd ready` first to get the bead ID. The actual first turn should only be `bd ready` (optionally with `Read MEMORY.md` in parallel), then the second turn handles the other commands. Session 0's data shows exactly this pattern, but R9 already covers it, so that's not a new improvement.\n\nI'm also noticing many text-only turns scattered through the session data that contain just thinking without any actual commands being executed. The real issue is that subsequent turns after getting the bead ID need to batch commands together—running `bd ready` alone is acceptable for turn 1 since the ID isn't available yet, but once that resolves, every following turn should combine multiple operations to avoid the narration-only pattern that's violating Rule B.\n\nLooking at the cost breakdown, the session spent $1.05 over 282 seconds with massive cache reads (847K tokens), which makes sense given the accumulated context, but I'm struggling to identify genuinely novel improvements beyond what's already covered by the existing rules.\n\nI'm realizing there's some confusion with the session numbering—what the metrics call \"Session 12\" is actually the 0-indexed session 11 in the file, which is the analysis session I'm currently running. Let me step back and systematically identify the top 3 patterns that aren't already documented in PROMPT.md.\n\nLooking through the evidence, the \"Important\" section at the bottom of PROMPT.md actually duplicates what's in Step 4b, though with slightly different instructions—the Important section correctly specifies sequential lint/test steps while Step 4b incorrectly suggests parallelism. But since R11 is already scheduled to fix Step 4b, this isn't a new improvement candidate.\n\nThe more interesting pattern is what happened in session 12: it created 2 new beads after the analysis session, but then...\n\nThe analysis agent should check whether beads already exist for improvements before creating duplicates, especially when the queue is already full with 17 open PROMPT.md fix beads.\n\nLooking at what R1-R17 actually cover, I'm noticing a gap: after `blacksmith finish`, the current PROMPT.md says to \"STOP\" but doesn't explain that the session result string should summarize what was accomplished. Let me trace through what the session outcomes actually show...\n\nThere's also a correctness issue in step 4b around the order of operations—specifically whether `cargo fmt --check` should run after `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` completes, since clippy's fixes may affect formatting. R11 addresses this, but I want to make sure the sequencing is actually right.\n\nLooking at the \"Stop Conditions\" section, there's some ambiguity about whether to use `blacksmith finish` alone or combine it with `blacksmith progress add` when bailing out of a failed attempt. The finish command in step 5 seems to handle recording and exiting already, so I need to clarify what the right approach is.\n\nActually, I see the issue now — `blacksmith finish` runs quality gates before closing the bead, and if those gates fail, the bead stays open. So for a failed attempt, I'd just record progress with `blacksmith progress add` and exit without calling finish, which contradicts the instruction to always use `blacksmith finish` to close out. would try quality gates, fail, and not close the bead - which is actually correct! The bead stays open (the `bd update --status=open` is redundant since blacksmith finish won't close it). But you'd want to record progress first.\n\nThe existing PROMPT.md has some conflicting guidance here. Under \"Stop Conditions\" it says to mark failures and record progress, then exit cleanly. The \"Marking a Failed Attempt\" section shows how to update the status, but there's no mention of running `blacksmith finish` for failed attempts - yet the \"Important\" section says to always use it to close out, which creates ambiguity.\n\nThis is a minor clarification issue worth about 8 points, but I should focus on what's actually driving the inefficiency. The real problems are zero parallel turns across all sessions, 34-39% text-only turns, and the fact that all the proposed improvements keep getting suggested but never implemented. The existing improvements R9 through R14 already target parallel usage, so I need to figure out why they haven't been adopted yet.\n\nLooking back at PROMPT.md, I notice the Rule A examples show clippy and test running in parallel, but R10 already identified this as incorrect. The problem is agents are reading this example, trying to follow it, realizing it won't work, then abandoning batching entirely. If I restructure Rule A to remove these misleading patterns and make the mandatory examples 100% correct, that could actually unblock the parallel improvements that are already proposed. I'm stepping back to look at what's actually new from the most recent analysis session beyond what the existing improvements already cover. The session metrics show high cache usage and a growing context size, which creates a feedback loop as each analysis adds more improvements that then bloat the context for future sessions.\n\nBut I can't address the context growth through prompt changes alone. Looking at the actual session patterns, I'm checking whether sessions 5 through 12 included any coding work or if they were all analysis runs. Scanning through the completion messages, they're consistently marked as analysis sessions with summary outputs—no coding sessions in that range, just repeated analysis cycles.\n\nThis reveals a loop problem where the analysis agent keeps getting invoked repeatedly, which is outside what I can fix with PROMPT.md edits. So I need to shift my approach and focus on what new improvements I can realistically add through prompt changes that haven't already been covered by the existing recommendations, keeping the score threshold at 6 or higher and limiting myself to three new additions.\n\nThe critical insight here is that even though Rules A and B explicitly address parallel execution in the prompt, the coding sessions still showed zero parallel turns. This suggests the issue isn't just about stating the rules more clearly—it might be something deeper about how the instructions are being processed. I'm noticing that the wrong examples embedded in those rules (like showing build and progress happening in parallel when they shouldn't, or cargo clippy and tests running together) could actually be backfiring. If an agent sees examples labeled as rules but then realizes they're incorrect, it might abandon parallel execution entirely rather than risk making the same mistake. Fixing those specific examples in R7 and R10 could genuinely address the zero-parallel-turns problem.\n\nFor truly new improvements beyond R1-R17, I'm looking at the specific patterns from session 4 and earlier data to identify what else might

Turn 1: `bd ready` (single call)\n2. Turn 2: `blacksmith progress show` (single call, could have been parallel with bd show)\n3. Turn 3: `bd show` (single call, could have been batched with turn 2)\n4. Turn 4: `Read MEMORY.md` (single call)\n5. Turn 5: `bd update --status in_progress` (single call)\n6. Turns 6-12: individual file reads (turns 6-12 = 7 sequential reads, should be parallel)\n\n\n7. Turns 13-17: sequential quality gate commands including clippy fixes and formatting checks\n8. Turns 18-19: progress tracking and completion calls\n\nThe biggest inefficiency is that turns 2-5 are all sequential operations that could've been batched together, and the file reads in turns 6-12 should definitely be parallelized instead of happening one at a time.\n\nFor the new pattern, I'm seeing that the initial setup phase could be consolidated significantly. Rather than spreading `bd show`, `blacksmith progress show`, reading MEMORY.md, and `bd update` across four separate turns, these could all execute in a single turn or at most two turns by combining the commands and file operations together.\n\nLooking at the file reading phase, batching all seven implementation file reads into one parallel turn would eliminate the sequential bottleneck there.\n\nNow I'm examining whether `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` can actually run in parallel. The current step says to run tests first, then lint in parallel, but I need to think through whether these two commands have dependencies on each other or if they're truly independent operations. py --fix MODIFIES source files\n  - If clippy modifies files WHILE tests are running, tests could fail for unexpected reasons\n  - So they should be sequential: test first, then clippy, then fmt\n\nBut wait, actually `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` runs clippy which finds issues and fixes them. If you're running `cargo test` at the same time, and clippy is modifying files... that could cause issues.\n\nHowever, looking at the session: `cargo test` ran on turn 15 (all tests ran against the current code), THEN `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` ran on turn 16 (fixing issues). These two COULD run in parallel since they operate on different stages (test reads code, clippy writes code) - actually no, if clippy modifies code while tests are running, you'd get inconsistent results.\n\nSo the sequential order IS correct. PROMPT.md says to run tests first, then clippy and fmt together in one turn, but R11 clarifies that clippy --fix and fmt --check need to be sequential since clippy modifies the code and fmt --check validates it afterward. So the proper sequence is: tests, then clippy --fix, then fmt --check across separate turns.\n\nI'm realizing the minimum viable approach is three sequential turns: test, clippy fix, then fmt check, since clippy's modifications need to be validated by fmt afterward.\n\nBut looking at what PROMPT.md actually specifies in step 4b, it's trying to run clippy and fmt in parallel after testing, which violates the dependency chain—fmt needs to check the code after clippy modifies it, not concurrently. Rule 11 correctly identifies this as a problem.\n\nI'm exploring whether there's any way to compress this further, like running test and fmt together beforehand since they're both read-only, but that doesn't actually save turns because fmt still needs to run after clippy makes its changes.\n\nThe simplest fix is just making them sequential as R11 says, so let me move on and identify some concrete new improvements beyond R1-R17. One thing I notice is that Session 4 had six consecutive file reads in turns 7-12 that could've been batched into parallel operations, and R13 touches on this but doesn't give explicit examples of how to restructure that pattern.\n\nActually, that's already covered by R13. Let me look elsewhere. I'm noticing something in the \"Marking a Failed Attempt\" section of PROMPT.md—when we mark an attempt as failed, we're not running `blacksmith finish` to clean up the session state. That seems like a gap. After updating the status to open with the failed attempt notes, we should also emit a finish command to properly close out that attempt before moving to the next one. Then the Stop Conditions say \"record progress with `blacksmith progress add`, exit cleanly\". But it doesn't say to run `blacksmith finish`. The Important section says \"Always use `blacksmith finish` to close out\". So there's ambiguity: for failed attempts, should you run `blacksmith finish` or just `blacksmith progress add` + exit?\n\nBut wait, `blacksmith finish` runs quality gates which will FAIL in a failed attempt scenario. The bead would NOT be closed (that's correct). But it would stage and attempt to commit... hmm.\n\nActually, looking at the step 5 flow: \"Run the finish command: blacksmith finish bd-X... If quality gates fail, the bead is NOT closed.\"\n\nFor a failed attempt where you've reverted changes, quality gates might actually pass since the original code is restored, which means `blacksmith finish` could try to commit even though there's nothing to commit. This is a genuine gap in the documentation—it should clarify whether failed attempts need `blacksmith finish` at all, or if reverting changes plus `blacksmith progress add` is sufficient to record the session without attempting a commit.\n\nThis is a minor clarification issue worth documenting as a new improvement candidate.\n\nNow I'm looking at session 4 data patterns and noticing the agent made several separate calls—updating status, checking the bead state, and viewing progress—across multiple turns when these could have been batched together, which R14 already addresses. I also see an exploratory `ls` command in turn 6 that seems unnecessary.\n\nThe PROMPT.md guidance says to only read files you're about to modify and avoid launching explore subagents, but it doesn't explicitly call out `ls` or `glob` for exploration. I could add a rule to prohibit directory exploration commands since the file structure is already documented in MEMORY.md, though this might just be an implicit extension of the existing \"only read what you need\" principle. The value-tractability tradeoff here feels marginal—maybe not worth filing as a separate improvement.\n\nBut stepping back, what would actually move the needle on session efficiency? The biggest drains are the lack of parallel turns despite explicit instructions, the high percentage of text-only turns, and multiple consecutive analysis sessions without coding. Most of those are already covered by the existing rules. So the real question is whether there are genuinely new patterns I'm missing that would have higher impact than R1-R17.\n\nLooking at the session data more carefully, I notice many turns contain extended thinking blocks, which are expensive in terms of tokens. I'm not sure yet whether that's something worth optimizing for, but it's worth investigating further.\n\nSession 12 is interesting because the cost breakdown shows heavy cache reads and creation, but without seeing the full token accounting, I can't pinpoint whether thinking tokens are the culprit. The session also had a file path issue when trying to read MEMORY.md.\n\nI'm noticing a clearer pattern in session 4: the agent ran `cargo check` before `cargo test --release`, which is wasteful since testing already compiles everything. That's a straightforward fix—I should add a rule to skip `cargo check` entirely and go straight to `cargo test --release`. This scores well on tractability even if it's a minor optimization. Improvement C adds explicit guidance on the failed-attempt exit sequence with all four required commands, scoring higher at 12 points. Now I'm considering whether there might be even more impactful improvements to prioritize instead.\n\nLooking back at the session data, every single coding run showed zero parallel turns and 34-39% text-only turns—that's a critical pattern. Improvements R9 through R15 all target this parallelism issue, but they're blocked waiting for the PROMPT.md fix beads to be completed. I'm wondering if there's a PROMPT.md change that could have an even stronger effect on parallelism than what's already planned.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something important: the Rule A examples at the top of PROMPT.md show parallel patterns, but some of them are incorrect. When an agent reads an example like \"bd ready + blacksmith progress show in ONE turn\" and it fails because you need the first command's output, the agent might either recognize the example is wrong and skip it, or play it safe and use sequential calls everywhere else. Those wrong examples in Rule A could be actively discouraging parallelism.\n\nThe fix would be ensuring every Rule A example is 100% correct and achievable—otherwise agents lose trust in the parallel instructions entirely. But looking at my improvements, R7 and R10 already cover this by fixing the broken session-start example and removing the wrong cargo clippy+test example. So the specific wrong examples are addressed, though the broader principle about maintaining trust through correct examples isn't explicitly stated in those improvements.\n\nI could add a comment to PROMPT.md explaining why the examples work, but that feels too speculative. Instead, I'm settling on three concrete improvements: skipping redundant `cargo check` runs (saves a turn per session), clarifying that failed attempts require `blacksmith finish` before exiting (prevents improper cleanup), and adding a note about the cargo check prohibition.\n\nActually, improvements one and three overlap—they're both about cargo operations. Let me reconsider. Looking back at session 4, I notice turn 14 wasted time exploring the test fixtures directory with `ls`. The third improvement should address this: prohibit directory exploration commands like `ls` and `find` during implementation, since the project structure is already documented in MEMORY.md and AGENTS.md. Any exploration that doesn't immediately lead to reading or modifying a file is a wasted turn and violates the rules.\n\nNow I'm scoring all the candidates. The failed-attempt exit path and the Rule A examples both score 12, while prohibiting cargo check separately and blocking directory exploration both score 10. The trust erosion from incorrect Rule A examples is conceptually important, but I'm weighing whether it's the right priority here.\n\nLooking at what would actually move the needle—the core issue is zero parallel turns across all sessions, and my current candidates don't directly address that. The existing rules already tackle parallelization from multiple angles. So instead of incremental tweaks, I should focus on identifying which single change to PROMPT.md would most likely unlock parallel turns.

That means the agent wrote something like \"Let me start by running bd ready\" as a text-only turn before actually calling bd ready. This is a Rule B violation at the very first turn.\n\nSimilarly, turns 6, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21, 22, 25 are all text-only.\n\nThis is very telling: the agent narrates BEFORE acting, consistently. The Rule B instruction \"NEVER emit a text-only turn\" is not being followed from the very first turn.\n\nThis suggests that the Rule B instruction might need to be even more emphatic at the very START of the session, before any turns have been taken. \n\nMaking Turn 1 a mandatory tool call could be the key insight here—if the agent's very first action must be a tool invocation rather than narration, it might prevent this pattern from taking root. This feels like a high-impact fix that could cascade into fewer violations throughout the entire session. to prevent narration-only turns\")? R15 adds reminders at steps 3, 4, 5. But Turn 1 happens BEFORE any step (it's the bd ready call from Rule A / Step 1). So a reminder specifically for Turn 1 would be NEW.\n\nAlso, R12 says \"Add turn-10 parallel checkpoint to catch Rule A violations early\" - this is for mid-session, not turn 1.\n\nLet me reconsider my 3 improvement candidates:\n\n**New Improvement 1**: Add Turn 1 constraint - first turn MUST start with bd ready tool call\nBody: \"Add to PROMPT.md above Rule A, as a new CRITICAL rule: 'Turn 1 MUST be a tool call. Do NOT write any text before calling bd ready. Your session's very first message must contain bd ready (and optionally Read MEMORY.md in parallel). Starting with text is an immediate Rule B violation.'\"\nScore: 25 (value=5, tractability=5)\n\n**New Improvement 2**: Clarify failed-attempt exit path\nScore: 12 (value=3, tractability=4)\n\n**New Improvement 3**: Prohibit cargo check and ls during implementation\nI should combine these into one rule that prevents wasted turns. The idea is to add guidance to Step 3 that blocks cargo check (since cargo test --release already handles compilation) and directory exploration commands like ls or find (since the structure is documented in MEMORY.md). This saves 1-2 turns per violation.\nScore: 10-12 (value=3, tractability=4-5)\n\nSo my final 3 are locked in. Now I need to execute: file each improvement as a bead, then run the commands to update PROMPT.md and create the beads.\n\nLet me verify the cargo check waste in session 4 turn 13 and the text-only turn 1 in session 0 are both confirmed before I proceed.\n\nI'm finalizing my three improvements and preparing to file them as beads and update the prompt accordingly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5763,"cache_read_input_tokens":53348,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5763,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61e8d025-4c85-4d48-ad54-31d3398764ee","uuid":"61257390-3fb0-48af-b2ca-705ba8edb4e3"}
