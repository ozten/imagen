Violating them wastes 25-35% of your turn budget.\n\n### Rule A: ALWAYS batch independent tool calls in the SAME turn.\nEvery time you are about to call a tool, ask: \"Is there another independent call I can make at the same time?\" If yes, emit BOTH tool calls in the SAME message.\n\n**Mandatory parallel patterns — use these EVERY session:**\n- Session start: `bd ready` + `blacksmith progress show --bead-id <id>` → ONE turn, TWO tool calls\n- Reading source + test: `Read foo.rs` + `Read foo_test.rs` → ONE turn\n- Multiple greps: `Grep(\"pattern1\")` + `Grep(\"pattern2\")` → ONE turn\n- Session end: `Bash(cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty)` + `Bash(cargo test --release)` → ONE turn (if they don't depend on each other's output)\n- Reading multiple related files: `Read config.rs` + `Read main.rs` → ONE turn\n\n**A session with ZERO parallel calls is a failure.** Target at least 5 turns with 2+ parallel calls per session.\n\n### Rule B: NEVER emit a text-only turn. Every assistant message MUST include at least one tool call.\nWRONG: \"Let me check the tests.\" (turn 1) → `Grep(tests/)` (turn 2)\nRIGHT: \"Let me check the tests.\" + `Grep(tests/)` (turn 1 — one message, includes both text AND tool call)\n\nIf you want to narrate what you're doing, include the narration AND the tool call in the same message.

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","id":"msg_01VdpERqZPYex52y9jB7KvbA","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Looking at the session 9 data, I can see that this is the previous analysis session (the self-improvement agent itself). There are numerous text-only turns (turns 1, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30, 34, 37, 42, 45) - and zero parallel tool calls.\n\nThis is a major problem. The self-improvement analysis agent itself is violating Rule B repeatedly.\n\nNow, let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check if any improvements were resolved**: The session data shows that session 9 was an analysis/self-improvement session itself. \n\nSince session 9 IS the previous self-improvement session (it ran at 2026-02-24T19:20:35Z based on the metrics table), these improvements haven't been implemented yet since they were just filed in that session. Let me check the other sessions to see what type of work they were doing and whether the parallelism improvements (R7, R8, R9) are actually taking effect. Looking at the git history and session data, the improvements R1-R9 were just filed in the most recent analysis session on 2026-02-24, so they haven't had time to be implemented yet. I should focus on analyzing new patterns from session 9 rather than promoting unaddressed improvements, and file additional improvements if new issues emerge from the data.\n\nExamining session 9 more closely, I'm seeing a recurring pattern where text-only turns are followed by single tool calls—turns 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 all follow this structure. This suggests the agent is treating analysis as something that requires narration before executing tools, rather than combining them. However, looking at the existing improvements already filed, R8 and R9 already address parallelism and context issues, so I need to check whether this pattern represents something genuinely new or if it's already covered by those improvements. I'm piecing together the session history now. Session 9 was indeed a self-improvement analysis that filed R7, R8, and R9, while R1-R6 had been filed in an earlier session. All nine improvements show the same filing date of 2026-02-24, so they were likely batched together, but the sessions that created them were separate.\n\nNow I'm starting a fresh analysis pass to identify new patterns worth documenting. Looking back at session 9, I notice the analysis agent itself generated several text-only turns across the 45-turn session, which seems to violate the \"NEVER emit a text-only turn\" rule in PROMPT.md. But I need to be careful here—that rule applies to coding sessions, not analysis sessions, which run under a different system prompt. Let me reconsider what I'm actually looking at and whether this is a legitimate pattern to file. I'm checking the session data to confirm session 9 was an analysis run, and I can see the tool usage patterns match the analysis agent workflow. Now I need to look at other sessions to understand what the coding agent sessions actually look

It shows turns 1-17 as the current session (me). And it already shows that I had text-only turns at 1, 8, 11, 13, 15. But wait, those early turns 1, 8, 11, etc. - looking at my own turns, I can see that I've been doing thinking-then-tool pattern.\n\nLet me refocus. The sessions 0-8 were mostly coding sessions (with some analysis sessions). They all had:\n- 0 parallel tool calls\n- Multiple text-only turns\n\nThis is a persistent systemic problem. \n\nThe existing improvements R7, R8, R9 are designed to address this but haven't been deployed yet. So I need to think about what additional improvements to propose beyond R1-R9. Looking at the pattern across all sessions, I'm seeing two key issues: the parallelization rule isn't being followed consistently - the examples in PROMPT.md for when to parallelize might not be specific enough about which scenarios actually warrant parallel calls, and the code quality step in 4b isn't running the linting and formatting checks in parallel like it should.\n\nThe \"Understand\" step also isn't taking advantage of parallelization when it could be - things like running `bd show` and reading related files could happen simultaneously. R5 through R9 already cover batching verify commands, fixing the broken startup example, adding parallel to the final verification, and introducing a context-loading step with parallel operations, so those main gaps seem addressed. Now I'm trying to figure out what else might be missing.\n\nActually, the \"Understand\" phase is inherently sequential since you can't know which files to read until after `bd show` completes, so that's not really an opportunity. The \"Implement\" step doesn't explicitly call out parallelism opportunities either - you could run multiple reads or greps in parallel there, though Rule A covers this generally. The \"Finish\" step has sequential dependencies by nature, so no gains there. I'm looking at whether the 4b quality checks could benefit from parallel execution.\n\nWait, I'm noticing something odd - all 11 sessions show zero parallel calls despite explicit instructions for things like running clippy and fmt together. The test command has to run first, but then those two could execute in parallel. This pattern across every session is suspicious. Either the model isn't effectively using parallel tool calls, or the sequential dependencies in the prompt are so strong that agents are correctly identifying them as necessary, or the instructions just aren't compelling enough to trigger parallelism.\n\nLooking at Rule A at the top of PROMPT.md, it explicitly states that zero parallel calls means failure and lists mandatory parallel patterns. Yet nothing's happening. R7 even flags a broken example - `bd ready` doesn't need a bead ID, but `blacksmith progress show` requires knowing the ID first, so they can't actually run in parallel despite being listed as a parallel pattern.\n\nIf agents are recognizing this example is impossible to implement, they might be abandoning parallelism altogether rather than finding other opportunities. This broken example at session start could be the reason we're seeing zero parallel calls across all sessions, even though R7 and R9 are supposed to address it.\n\nLet me look for different parallelizable patterns in the actual session data.\n\nI'm noticing something consistent: sessions show a \"text-only → single tool → text-only → single tool\" rhythm, which suggests agents are narrating their actions separately instead of combining them. Rule B explicitly forbids text-only turns and requires every assistant message to include a tool call, but it's happening in every session regardless. The rule exists in the prompt but isn't being followed, so the real question is why agents aren't adhering to it.\n\nLooking at the Rule B examples in PROMPT.md, they only illustrate the narration-before-action failure case. What if agents are actually doing thinking-after-action instead—emitting tool results first, then narrating about them—which the examples don't explicitly address?\n\nExamining the turn patterns in Session 9, there's a clear alternating rhythm of text-only turns appearing after tool calls, suggesting agents are using separate turns for reflection and analysis. The solution is to expand Rule B with concrete examples showing that both pre-action narration and post-result reflection as isolated text turns violate the efficiency rule, then demonstrate how to combine reflection with the next tool call in a single turn.\n\nNow I'm looking at the cost metrics for this 312-second session—$1.05 with 786,431 cache read tokens is notably high, indicating a large context window being maintained throughout the analysis.\n\nChecking back through session 10, I see there are actually several text-only turns scattered throughout (turns 1, 8, 11, 13, 15), which are likely thinking-focused moments where I'm processing results rather than generating code or examples.\n\nLet me prioritize the improvements to file, starting with adding a post-result reflection example to Rule B that explicitly demonstrates thinking-only turns. I'm noticing a potential inconsistency in the rule structure—step 4b mentions running cargo test and clippy+fmt in parallel within a single turn, but the actual instructions seem to list them sequentially across separate turns instead. This suggests agents might be splitting what should be combined operations into multiple turns, which would violate the efficiency goal. I'm realizing the core issue: clippy --fix modifies files while fmt --check only reads them, so they can't safely run in parallel either. The safest approach is running these sequentially—test first, then clippy --fix, then fmt --check—since each step depends on the previous one completing cleanly. Rule A's example needs to be corrected to reflect this dependency chain rather than suggesting parallel execution. I'm realizing the core issue: clippy --fix modifies source files, so running it in parallel with fmt --check creates a race condition where fmt might see an inconsistent state. The safer approach is to sequence them—run tests first, then clippy --fix with --allow-dirty, followed by fmt to clean up any formatting changes clippy introduces.\n\nSo the main improvement needed is removing that misleading parallel example from Rule A's mandatory patterns, since clippy and test can't safely run together when clippy is modifying files. I'd score that at 16 for impact.\n\nThe other candidates are adding a post-result reflection example to Rule B to show violations beyond just pre-action narration, and then checking what else might need attention.\n\nBut before filing more, I should think strategically about why all sessions show zero parallel calls. Looking at the mandatory patterns themselves—like `bd ready` plus `blacksmith progress show`, or reading multiple files, or running greps—these either have dependencies the agents correctly identify, or the bead work domain just doesn't naturally create many opportunities for parallelization. So the real issue might be that Rule A's examples are misleading rather than the agents being overly cautious.\n\nThe most impactful fix would be correcting the broken and contradictory examples in Rule A and adding 2-3 genuinely achievable parallel patterns. Since R7 and R9 already address the session-start example, my incremental improvement should focus on fixing the quality gates example instead.\n\nLooking at the contradiction: Rule A's mandatory patterns list shows clippy + test as a single-turn parallel operation, but the quality gates section already demonstrates clippy + fmt --check as the correct parallel pair. I should update Rule A to align with what actually works—replacing the clippy + test pattern with clippy + fmt --check to eliminate the confusion. I'm identifying three concrete improvements to the prompt. The first is fixing the cargo clippy and test example in Rule A—they actually do depend on each other's output since clippy modifies files, so I need to replace it with a genuinely parallel example. The second improvement adds \"post-result reflection\" as a violation type under Rule B with concrete wrong and right examples. The third adds explicit parallel guidance to the Implement section, reminding to emit all file reads and grep calls together in one turn rather than sequentially. Let me draft these edits for the prompt document.\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering the second improvement. Rule B already states absolutely that every assistant message must include at least one tool call—no text-only turns allowed. The existing examples show one specific case, and adding another example might help marginally, but the rule itself is already crystal clear. The real issue might be something different entirely, like agents treating thinking blocks differently from actual text content, or the rule simply not being visible or salient enough in practice.\n\nLooking at the session data more carefully, I'm noticing patterns that suggest the most impactful fix would be either correcting the parallel example in Rule A since it's clearly wrong, or adding a self-check mechanism like \"count your text-only turns after every 10 turns and re-read Rule B if you find more than one.\" The third option of adding explicit parallel examples to the Implement section would also help, but I need to prioritize which change would actually move the needle on agent behavior.\n\nWait—I'm looking at session 10 data and seeing multiple text-only turns, but these are actually from my current analysis session, not from the coding sessions I'm trying to fix. That means the issue isn't with PROMPT.md at all; it's with the analysis system prompt itself, which I can't edit. So any improvements I make to PROMPT.md won't affect these analysis sessions.\n\nLet me check the actual coding sessions 0-8 to see if they had text-only turns.\n\nLooking at the raw data across all sessions, I'm noticing the most critical pattern: every single session has zero parallel calls. That's the biggest issue. The text-only turns are secondary. I also spotted that Rule A's mandatory parallel examples include a flawed case with cargo clippy and test that shouldn't be marked as parallel-safe, and R7 already flags a broken session-start example.\n\nSo my improvement strategy is to fix that Rule A example by removing the incorrect clippy-and-test case, since that's misleading developers about what can actually run in parallel. I've identified three concrete improvements that don't overlap with the existing ones: fixing the parallel pattern example in line 14 for quality gates, adding batch read guidance to the Implement step, and strengthening Rule B with a turn-counting self-check. Now I'm verifying these are genuinely new by checking against R1-R9, and they are—the existing improvements focus on startup and verification steps, while mine target the quality gates example, implementation guidance, and rule enforcement.\n\nLooking at the session 9 data, I need to assess which of the earlier improvements have actually been resolved. R1 through R6 are still pending—the verification requirement for beads, the fast-path issue, clippy handling, memory file loading, parallel batching, and error text inclusion all need implementation work.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern here: analysis sessions keep filing these improvement beads, but they're not getting implemented between runs. This suggests either the improvements are being worked on elsewhere without being tested, or they're just accumulating without action.\n\nLet me proceed with my original plan and not promote any of these unresolved items.\n\nNow I need to draft some specific improvements for PROMPT.md. The key issue I'm seeing is that the parallel execution examples in Rule A aren't actually correct—I need to think through what can legitimately run in parallel for a quality gate workflow. The cargo commands have dependencies: tests need to pass first before running clippy fixes, and format checks should come after modifications are made. I should propose a corrected example that reflects these actual constraints. A more impactful approach would be adding negative reinforcement—explicitly warning agents they'll fail if they don't use parallel calls by a certain turn threshold.

None have been implemented yet.\n\n2. **Rule A line 14**: Shows `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` + `cargo test --release` → ONE turn with the caveat \"(if they don't depend on each other's output)\" - but they DO have a dependency since clippy --fix modifies source files.\n\n\n3. **Step 4b (lines 86-90)** contradicts this by correctly ordering test first, then running clippy and fmt in parallel afterward. But there's a fundamental issue here: Rule A suggests clippy and test can run together in one turn, while step 4b recognizes that tests must complete before clippy --fix modifies the codebase.\n\nThe real problem is that even in step 4b's approach, clippy --fix and fmt --check can't safely run in parallel since clippy modifies source files while fmt is reading them to check formatting. The intended sequence seems to be clippy fixing files first, then fmt verifying the result, but they're being treated as concurrent operations when they need to be sequential.\n\nThe most practical fix is to replace the incorrect parallel example in Rule A line 14 with something that actually works in parallel, like multiple grep calls during the integration check phase. For now, I'll focus on documenting which improvements are still open and which new ones need to be filed based on these issues. I'm identifying three concrete issues to fix: the quality-gate example in Rule A uses sequential operations when it should demonstrate parallelism, none of the example sessions actually show parallel calls despite the rule requiring them, and step 4b has a contradiction about whether clippy and fmt can run together. I'll correct the Rule A example, add a checkpoint at turn 10 to catch these violations early, and clarify that clippy must finish before fmt runs. at the data one more time and determine the most impactful 3 improvements, then file them.\n\nFrom the metrics:\n- 0/11 sessions have parallel calls (catastrophic)\n- Most sessions have text-only turns\n\nThe root causes:\n1. Rule A's mandatory parallel examples include WRONG examples (clippy+test) that agents correctly detect as non-parallelizable\n2. No early checkpoint to catch Rule A violations\n3. The alternating text+tool pattern suggests agents aren't internalizing Rule B\n\nImprovements to file:\n1. **Fix wrong parallel example in Rule A**: Remove `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` + `cargo test --release` and replace with `Grep(\"pattern1\")` + `Grep(\"pattern2\")` as the quality-gate parallel example, since multiple grep calls for integration checking (step 4c) ARE truly parallel.\n\n2. **Add parallel self-check at turn 10**: Insert a checkpoint in the turn budget section that flags zero parallel turns as a Rule A violation and forces batching of the next tool calls.\n\n3. **Fix step 4b contradiction**: The prompt currently describes clippy and fmt running in one turn with parallel bash calls, but clippy modifies files that fmt then checks, making them
